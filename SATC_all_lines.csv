33,1.0,1.0,Elizabeth,"In England, looking at houses together would have meant something.",
34,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Then I realized no one had told her about the end of love in Manhattan.,
35,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Welcome to the age of ""un-innocence.",
36,1.0,1.0,Carrie,""" No one has breakfast at Tiffany's, and no one has affairs to remember.",
37,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Instead, we have breakfast at 7:00 a.m.",

45,1.0,1.0,Carrie,They'll spend $400 on a pair of Manolo Blahnik strappy sandals.,
46,1.0,1.0,Carrie,And they're alone.,
47,1.0,1.0,Carrie,It's like the riddle of the Sphinx.,
48,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Why are there so many great unmarried women and no great unmarried men? I explore these sorts of issues in my column and I have terrific sources: my friends.,
49,1.0,1.0,Peter Mason,"When you're a young guy in your 20s, women are controlling the relationship.",
50,1.0,1.0,Peter Mason,So by the time you're an eligible man in your 30s you feel like you're being devoured by women.,
51,1.0,1.0,Peter Mason,"Suddenly, the guys are holding all the chips.",
52,1.0,1.0,Peter Mason,I call it the mid-30s power flip.,
53,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,It's all about age and biology.,
54,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,"I mean, if you want to get married, it's to have kids, right? Not with someone older than 35, 'cause you have to have kids right away and that's about it.",
55,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,I think these women should just forget about marriage and have a good time.,

61,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,Most men are threatened by successful women.,
62,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,"If you want to get these guys, you have to keep your mouth shut and play by the rules.",
63,1.0,1.0,Skipper,I totally believe that love conquers all.,
64,1.0,1.0,Skipper,Sometimes you just have to give it a little space and that's exactly what's missing in Manhattan-- the space for romance.,
65,1.0,1.0,Peter Mason,The problem is expectations.,
66,1.0,1.0,Peter Mason,Older women don't want to settle for what's available.,
67,1.0,1.0,Miranda,"By the time you reach your mid-30s you think, ""Why should I settle?"" You know?",
68,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,"It's like the older we get, the more we keep self-selecting down to a smaller and smaller group.",
69,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,What women really want is Alec Baldwin.,
70,1.0,1.0,Peter Mason,There's not one woman in New York who hasn't turned down 10 wonderful guys because they were too short or too fat or too poor.,
71,1.0,1.0,Miranda,"I have been out with some of those guys-- the short, fat, poor ones.",
72,1.0,1.0,Miranda,It makes absolutely no difference.,
73,1.0,1.0,Miranda,They are just as self-centered and unappreciative as the good-looking ones.,
74,1.0,1.0,Peter Mason,"Why don't these women just marry a fat guy? Why don't they just marry a big, fat tub of lard?",
75,1.0,1.0,Group,"Happy birthday, dear Miranda Happy birthday to you",

78,1.0,1.0,Miranda,- You were saying?,
79,1.0,1.0,Samantha," Look. If you're a successful single woman in this city, you have two choices: You can bang your head against the wall and try and find a relationship or you can say ""screw it,"" and just go out and have sex like a man.",
80,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,- You mean with dildos?,

91,1.0,1.0,Samantha,""" And I completely forgot about him after that.",
92,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,But are you sure that isn't just 'cause he didn't call you? ,
93,1.0,1.0,Samantha,"Sweetheart, this is the first time in the history of Manhattan that women have had as much money and power as men plus the equal luxury of treating men like sex objects.",
94,1.0,1.0,Miranda,"Yeah, except men in this city fail on both counts.",
95,1.0,1.0,Miranda,"I mean, they don't want to be in a relationship with you but as soon as you only want them for sex, they don't like it.",
96,1.0,1.0,Miranda,All of a sudden they can't perform the way they're supposed to.,
97,1.0,1.0,Samantha,- That's when you dump them.,

102,1.0,1.0,Miranda,"I mean, the sex was incredible.",
103,1.0,1.0,Miranda,"But then he wanted to read me his poetry and go out to dinner and the whole chat bit, and I'm like, ""Let's not even go there.",
104,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,""" What are you saying? That you're just going to give up on love? - That's sick.",
105,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"- No, no, no.",

107,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,- That's right! ,
108,1.0,1.0,Samantha,Listen to me! The right guy is an illusion.,
109,1.0,1.0,Samantha,Start living your lives.,
110,1.0,1.0,Carrie,So you think it's really possible to pull off this whole women-having-sex-like-men thing?,

114,1.0,1.0,Samantha,"And never having one of those ""Oh, my God, what have I done?"" epiphanies.",
115,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,I hated that movie.,
116,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Was it true? Were women in New York really giving up on love and throttling up on power? What a tempting thought.,
117,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,I'm beginning to think the only place one can still find love and romance in New York is the gay community.,
118,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,It's straight love that's become closeted.,
119,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Stanford Blatch was one of my closest friends.,

122,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,"How could I possibly sustain a relationship? You know Derek takes up like, a thousand percent of my time.",
123,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Don't you think that's a bit obsessive?,
124,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,Carrie I'm a passionate person. His career is all I care about.,
125,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,"When that's under control, then I can concentrate on my personal life.",

129,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,Don't turn around.,
130,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,The loathe of your life is at the bar.,
131,1.0,1.0,Carrie,It was Kurt Harrington a mistake I made when I was 26 and 29 and 31.,
132,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,"Carrie, don't even go there.",
133,1.0,1.0,Carrie,What? Do you think I'm a masochist? - The man is scum.,
134,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,- Good.,
135,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,Because I don't have the patience to clean up this mess for the fourth time.,
136,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Will you relax? I don't have a shred of feeling left.,
137,1.0,1.0,Stanford Blatch,Thank God.,
138,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to visit the ladies' room.",
139,1.0,1.0,Carrie,It was true.,
140,1.0,1.0,Carrie,I no longer felt a thing for Kurt.,
141,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"After all these years, I finally saw him for what he was: a self-centered, withholding creep who was still the best sex I ever had in my life.",
142,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"However, I did have a little experiment in mind.",
143,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Kurt. Wow. What are you doin' here?,

158,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Who said anything about talking?,
159,1.0,1.0,Kurt Harrington,"What do you say to my place, 3:00?",
160,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Alright. See ya there.,

163,1.0,1.0,Carrie,It's research.,
164,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Oh, God.",
165,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Oh, Kurt.",
166,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Kurt was just like I remembered-- better-- because this time there would be none of that messy emotional attachment.,
167,1.0,1.0,Kurt Harrington,All righty.,
168,1.0,1.0,Kurt Harrington,My turn.,
169,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Oh, sorry.",

194,1.0,1.0,Skipper,I just have so much feeling.,

208,1.0,1.0,Skipper,Great.,
209,1.0,1.0,Skipper,Don't tell her I'm nice.,
210,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Miranda was gonna hate Skipper.,
211,1.0,1.0,Carrie,She'd think he was mocking her with his sweet nature and decide he was an asshole the way she had decided all men were assholes.,

222,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,And another thing.,
223,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,I'm not buying any of that women-having-sex-like-men crap.,

240,1.0,1.0,Miranda,""" That's funny, Skippy.",
241,1.0,1.0,Skipper,- Skipper.,
242,1.0,1.0,Miranda,- I have this theory that men secretly hate pretty girls because they rejected them in school.,
243,1.0,1.0,Skipper,Right.,
244,1.0,1.0,Skipper,"But if you're not part of the ""Beauty Olympics"" you can still become a very interesting person.",
245,1.0,1.0,Miranda,Are you saying that I'm not pretty enough? ,
246,1.0,1.0,Skipper,"No, no, no. Of course you are.",
247,1.0,1.0,Miranda,"So, ipso f acto, I can't be interesting? Women fall into one of two categories: beautiful and boring or homely and interesting, is that it?",
248,1.0,1.0,Skipper,"No, that's not what I meant.",
249,1.0,1.0,Miranda,Excuse me.,

253,1.0,1.0,Miranda,- Or interesting.,
254,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"- I was about to rescue Skipper from an increasingly hopeless situation, when suddenly-- ",
255,1.0,1.0,Kurt Harrington,"Lucky me, twice in one week.",
256,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Well, I don't know if you're going to be getting that lucky.",
257,1.0,1.0,Kurt Harrington,"You know, I was really pissed off the way you left the other day.",
258,1.0,1.0,Carrie,- You were?,
259,1.0,1.0,Kurt Harrington,"Yeah. Then I thought, how great! You finally understand the kind of relationship I want and now we can have sex without commitment.",
260,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Yeah.,
261,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Right.,
262,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Sure.,
263,1.0,1.0,Carrie,I guess.,

271,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Yup.,
272,1.0,1.0,Carrie,I didn't understand.,
273,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Did all men secretly want their women promiscuous and emotionally detached? And if I was really having sex like a man, why didn't I feel more in control? ",
274,1.0,1.0,Samantha,You see that guy? He's the next Donald Trump except he's younger and much better looking.,
275,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Hi.,
276,1.0,1.0,Samantha,- You know him? ,
277,1.0,1.0,Carrie,No. I've never seen him in my life.,
278,1.0,1.0,Samantha,"He usually dates models, but, hey, I'm as good-looking as a model plus I own my own business.",
279,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Samantha had the kind of deluded self-confidence that caused men like Ross Perot to run for president and it usually got her what she wanted.,
280,1.0,1.0,Samantha,"Well, if you're not gonna hit on him, I will.",
281,1.0,1.0,Carrie,And there she went-- off to take her best shot with Big.,
282,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Charlotte York was having a splendid evening with Capote Duncan.",
283,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,Wanna go back to my place and see the Ross Blechner?,
284,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,"I'd love to, but it's really getting late.",
285,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,No problem.,
286,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,- What year was it painted again?,
287,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,89.,
288,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Though Charlotte was determined to play hard-to-get she didn't want to end the evening too abruptly.,
289,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,"Well, maybe just for a minute.",
290,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,This could easily go for a hundred grand.,
291,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,Ross is so hot right now.,
292,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,It's beautiful.,
293,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,"No, you're beautiful.",
294,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,Thank you for tonight.,
295,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,- Yeah?,
296,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,I had a wonderful time.,
297,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,"Well, it was my pleasure.",
298,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,I have to get up really early tomorrow.,
299,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,I'll get you a cab.,
300,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Charlotte told me she thought she had played the entire evening flawlessly.,
301,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,"So, what are you doing next Saturday?",
302,1.0,1.0,Charlotte, I'm having dinner with you.,
303,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,"- You're going to the West Side, right?",
304,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,Right.,
305,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,"West Fourth and Bank, please.",
306,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,"Hey, scoot over, will ya? Two stops: Fourth and Bank and West Broadway and Broom.",
307,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,- You're going to Chaos? ,
308,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,Oh. Yeah.,
309,1.0,1.0,Charlotte,Why?,
310,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,"Look, I understand where you're coming from and I totally respect it but I really need to have sex tonight.",
311,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Back at Chaos things were swinging into high gear and Samantha was putting the moves on Big.,
312,1.0,1.0,Big,I've been smoking cigars for years back when they were terminally uncool.,
313,1.0,1.0,Samantha,I've got this great source that sends me Hondurans.,
314,1.0,1.0,Samantha,Do you want to try one?,
315,1.0,1.0,Big,"No, thank you.",
316,1.0,1.0,Samantha,- Really? You can't find them anywhere.,
317,1.0,1.0,Big,Cohibas-- that's all I smoke.,
318,1.0,1.0,Samantha,"Look, I do the PR for this club and I have the key to the private room downstairs.",
319,1.0,1.0,Big,Really? ,
320,1.0,1.0,Samantha,You want a private tour? ,
321,1.0,1.0,Big,"No, thanks, but maybe another time.",
322,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Meanwhile Skipper was hopelessly smitten with Miranda Hobbes.,
323,1.0,1.0,Skipper,"- So, where we goin' now?",
324,1.0,1.0,Miranda,"Listen, Skippy you know, you really are a nice, sweet guy, but-- ",
325,1.0,1.0,Skipper,"Oh, I understand.",
326,1.0,1.0,Miranda,Good night.,
327,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Miranda told me later that she thought he was too nice but that she was willing to overlook one flaw and Capote Duncan found his fix for the night.,
328,1.0,1.0,Samantha,Where is it? I wanna see the Ross Blechner.,
329,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,Wait.,
330,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,Later.,
331,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,Later.,
332,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,"Oh, listen, l-- I gotta get up really early and, actually, you can't stay over.",
333,1.0,1.0,Capote Duncan,Cool? ,
334,1.0,1.0,Samantha,Sure. I have to get up really early too.,
335,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Taxi! Taxi! And so another Friday night in Manhattan crept towards dawn.,
336,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Just when I thought I would have to do the unspeakable-- walk home-- ,
337,1.0,1.0,Big,"Well, get in, for Christ's sakes.",
338,1.0,1.0,Big,- Where can I drop you?,
339,1.0,1.0,Carrie,72nd Street and Third Avenue.,
340,1.0,1.0,Big,"- Have you got that, Al?",
341,1.0,1.0,Al,Yes sir.,
342,1.0,1.0,Big,"So, what have you been doing lately? ",
343,1.0,1.0,Carrie,You mean besides going out every night?,
344,1.0,1.0,Big,"I mean, what do you do for work?",
345,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Well, this is my work.",
346,1.0,1.0,Carrie,I'm sort of a sexual anthropologist.,
347,1.0,1.0,Big,You mean like a hooker? ,
348,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"No. I write a column called ""Sex and the City.",
349,1.0,1.0,Carrie,""" Right now I'm researching an article about women who have sex like men.",
350,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"You know, they have sex and then afterwards they feel nothing.",
351,1.0,1.0,Big,- But you're not like that.,
352,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"- Well, aren't you? ",
353,1.0,1.0,Big,Not a drop. Not even half a drop.,
354,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Wow.,
355,1.0,1.0,Carrie,What's wrong with you?,
356,1.0,1.0,Big, I get it. You've never been in love.,
357,1.0,1.0,Carrie,"Oh, yeah? ",
358,1.0,1.0,Big,Yeah.,
359,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Suddenly I felt the wind knocked out of me.,
360,1.0,1.0,Carrie,I wanted to crawl under the covers and go right to sleep.,
361,1.0,1.0,Carrie,- Thanks for the ride.,
362,1.0,1.0,Big,- Anytime.,
363,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Wait.,
364,1.0,1.0,Carrie,Have you ever been in love? ,
365,1.0,1.0,Big,Abso-fuckin'-lutely.,
366,1.0,1.0,,,
0,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Last night my friend Miranda got invited to a dinner party by a man she hardly knew.,
1,1.0,2.0,Carrie,She was the date of Nick a fairly successful sports agent who once told her she had nice legs.,x

20,1.0,2.0,Daves Girlfriend ,So how long have you known Nick? ,
21,1.0,2.0,Miranda , We've been riding the same elevator line for years and then we had lunch a few weeks ago and then he invited me here to dinner.,
22,1.0,2.0,Dinner Guest 1,- He's very smart.,
23,1.0,2.0,Daves Girlfreind,- Guess he took our ultimatum seriously.,
24,1.0,2.0,Dinner Guest 1,- Deanne.,

46,1.0,2.0,Carrie,It got to be a problem.,
47,1.0,2.0,Carrie,They decided to take action.,
48,1.0,2.0,Dinner Guest 1,"Can't you find a woman who can carry on a decent conversation? Yeah, Nick.",
49,1.0,2.0,Deanne,And eat without purging.,
50,1.0,2.0,Nick,What are you saying? You can't bring around any more of these so-called models.,
51,1.0,2.0,Dinner Guest 1 ,It's too depressing.,

60,1.0,2.0,Nick,"It's true, okay? I'm obsessed.",
61,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,- Obsessed with models.,
62,1.0,2.0,Nick,- Correct.,
63,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,So what am l? Your intellectual beard for the evening? ,
64,1.0,2.0,Nick,"Don't be pissed, all right? You gotta admit, you met some nice people.",
65,1.0,2.0,Nick,You had a good time.,
66,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Okay? You were on a date with a modelizer and you didn't even know it? ,
67,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,"If men like Nick are dating models, what chance do ordinary women have? Do you have to be a supermodel to get a date in New York? Modelizers are a particular breed.",
68,1.0,2.0,Carrie,They're a step beyond womanizers who will sleep with just about anything in a skirt.,
69,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"Modelizers are obsessed not with women, but with models who in most cities are safely confined to billboards and magazines but in Manhattan, actually run wild on the streets turning the city into a virtual Model Country Safari where men can pet the creatures in their natural habitat.",
70,1.0,2.0,Carrie,As if we didn't have enough problems.,
71,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,They're stupid and lazy and should be shot on sight.,

73,1.0,2.0,Samantha,"I'm like, well-- I'm like a model who's taken the high road.",
74,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,"The advantages given to models and to beautiful women in general are so unfair, it makes me puke.",
75,1.0,2.0,Samantha,"- Sweetheart, you are so cute.",
76,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,- Cute doesn't cut it in this town.,
77,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,What's cute compared to supermodel? ,
78,1.0,2.0,Carrie ,There's nothing like raising the subject of models among four single women to spice up an otherwise dull Tuesday night.,
79,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,"They have this distant, sexy look.",
80,1.0,2.0,Samantha,"That's not sexy, it's starvation.",
81,1.0,2.0,Charlotte,That's starvation in the best restaurants.,
82,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,"What I wanna know is when did all the men get together and decide that they would only get it up for giraffes with big breasts? In some cultures, heavy women with mustaches are considered beautiful.",
83,1.0,2.0,Samantha,You're looking at me while you're saying that?,
84,1.0,2.0,Miranda , We should just admit that we live in a culture that promotes impossible standards of beauty.,
85,1.0,2.0,Carrie,- Except men think they're possible.,
86,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,- Yeah.,
87,1.0,2.0,Charlotte,"No matter how good I feel about myself if I see Christy Turlington, I just wanna give up.",
88,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,"I wanna force-feed her lard, but that's the difference between you and me.",
89,1.0,2.0,Carrie,What are you talking about? Look at you two.,
90,1.0,2.0,Carrie,You're beautiful.,
91,1.0,2.0,Charlotte,- I hate my thighs.,
92,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"- Oh, come on.",
93,1.0,2.0,Charlotte,"I can't even open a magazine without thinking, ""thighs, thighs, thighs.",
94,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,""" I'll take your thighs and raise you a chin.",
95,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,I'll take your chin and raise you a-- ,
96,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"What? Oh, come on.",
97,1.0,2.0,Samantha,I happen to love the way I look.,
98,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,You should.,
99,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,You paid enough for it.,
100,1.0,2.0,Samantha,"Hey, I resent that.",
101,1.0,2.0,Samantha,I do not believe in plastic surgery.,
102,1.0,2.0,Samantha,"Well, not yet.",
103,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I find it fascinating that four beautiful flesh and blood women could be intimidated by some unreal fantasy.,
104,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"I mean, look.",
105,1.0,2.0,Charlotte,Look at this.,
106,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Is this really intimidating to any of you? -,
107,1.0,2.0,Charlotte,I hate my thighs.,
108,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,- Pass the chicken.,
109,1.0,2.0,Samantha,I have that dress.,
110,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Suddenly I was interested.,
111,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"If models could cause otherwise rational individuals to crumble in their presence, exactly how powerful was beauty? There are two types of guys that fall for beautiful women.",
112,1.0,2.0,Woman 1,Either they're slime-balls that are just out to get laid or they fall in love with you instantly.,
113,1.0,2.0,Woman1,It's pathetic.,
114,1.0,2.0,Nick,Why fuck the girl in the skirt if you can fuck the girl in the ad for the skirt? Being beautiful is such a power.,
115,1.0,2.0,Model,You can get whatever you want.,
116,1.0,2.0,Model,You can get anything.,
117,1.0,2.0,Model,"I've been off ered trips to Aspen, weekends in Paris Christmas in St.",
118,1.0,2.0,Model,Barts.,
119,1.0,2.0,Model Man,"A motorcycle, a juicer.",
120,1.0,2.0,Nick,It's not like models don't have brains.,
121,1.0,2.0,Nick,They have them.,
122,1.0,2.0,Nick,They just don't need to use them.,
123,1.0,2.0,Woman 2,"Most guys just think you're dumb, but I'm really very literary.",
124,1.0,2.0,Woman 2 ,I read.,
125,1.0,2.0,Woman 2,I'll sit down and read a whole magazine from cover to cover.,

127,1.0,2.0,Model ,"A Bulgari necklace, a breast job.",
128,1.0,2.0,Nick,My friends think I'm shallow.,
129,1.0,2.0,Nick,Sometimes I think they're right.,
130,1.0,2.0,Nick,"Other times I think, ""Hey, I'm fucking a model.",
131,1.0,2.0,Barkley,""" Models are a lot looser than you think.",
132,1.0,2.0,Barkley,It's way easier to screw a model than a regular girl 'cause that's what they do all the time.,
133,1.0,2.0,Barkley,It's how regular people are when they're on vacation.,
134,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"Barkley, a notorious modelizer was one of those SoHo wonders who maintained a fabulous lifestyle despite never having sold a single painting.",x
135,1.0,2.0,Carrie,So you're saying it's easy to meet them?,
136,1.0,2.0,Barkley,"No, it's not so easy.",
137,1.0,2.0,Barkley,"The trick is, you gotta treat them like they're regular girls.",
138,1.0,2.0,Barkley,"You gotta be able to roll into a place, walk up to the hottest thing there.",
139,1.0,2.0,Barkley,Otherwise you're finished.,

163,1.0,2.0,Barkley,Sure.,
164,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Later that day I was relieved to discover that at least one eligible bachelor got his kicks off the runway.,
165,1.0,2.0,Skipper,- So I totally dig your friend Miranda.,
166,1.0,2.0,Carrie,- That's great.,

187,1.0,2.0,Skipper,"You better call me back! No, I'm kidding.",
188,1.0,2.0,Skipper,I'm joking.,
189,1.0,2.0,Skipper,"But seriously, I hope you call me back and did I mention this was Skipper?",

218,1.0,2.0,Derek,- Bye.,
219,1.0,2.0,Stanford,"Can you believe anyone that beautiful can be that nice? I keep dreaming that someday he's gonna say, ""Stanford, I love you.",
220,1.0,2.0,Carrie,""" - Is he gay? - He denies it.",
221,1.0,2.0,Stanford,How could anyone that gorgeous be straight? ,
222,1.0,2.0,Samantha,"Sweetie, over here!",
223,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Samantha Jones never missed a major fashion show.She was one of the only people I knew who thought that proximity to beauty made her feel more attractive.,
224,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"Hey, sweetie, what happened? You couldn't find seats right on the runway? Oh, you can see all the flaws from this angle.",
225,1.0,2.0,Samantha,"- Hey, Carrie.",

237,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"Actually, he's sleeping with all of them in general.",
238,1.0,2.0,Samantha,- Only models? - Only models.,
239,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Later that night we all went downtown f or a party.,
240,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I was beginning to float away on a sea of sweet potato puffs with smoked salmon and sour cream when-- It was Mr.,
241,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"Big: major tycoon major dream boat, and majorly out of my league.",
242,1.0,2.0,Big,I thought I saw you on the runway.,
243,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Hi.,
244,1.0,2.0,Big,I started reading your column after we met.,

248,1.0,2.0,Big,"Well-- Yeah, cute.",
249,1.0,2.0,Big ,What are you writing about this week? ,
250,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"Well, I'm working on a story about menwho date models.",
251,1.0,2.0,Carrie,- Any thoughts? - ,
252,1.0,2.0,Big,Only that they're very lucky.So what have you discovered about these men who are dating models? ,
253,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"Well, I'm discovering that some of them treat it as a competitive sport and others I think just need the validation.",
254,1.0,2.0,Carrie,And probably others just have a thing for exceptionally beautiful women.,
255,1.0,2.0,Big,Exactly.,
256,1.0,2.0,Big,And there's something wrong with that? There's nothing wrong.,
257,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I just think it might become a bit monotonous.,
258,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Puff? - ,
259,1.0,2.0,Big,"No, thanks.",
260,1.0,2.0,Stranger,- Excuse me.,

262,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"My cute stories?About half the time I'm at my apartment, and the other half I'm over at this coffee shop on 73rd and Madison.",
263,1.0,2.0,Big ,"Oh, Carrie, I'd like you to meet Misha.",
264,1.0,2.0,Carrie,- Hi.,
265,1.0,2.0,Carrie,You were great in the show.,
266,1.0,2.0,Misha,- Thank you.,
267,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Suddenly I felt like I was wearing patchouli in a room full of Chanel.,
268,1.0,2.0,Big,"Well, it was nice talking to you.",
269,1.0,2.0,Mr.Big,"See you around sometime, I hope.",
270,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I thought I had come to terms with my looks the year I turned 30 when I realized that I no longer had the energy to be completely superficial.,
271,1.0,2.0,Samantha,"Your friend Barkley, he's really been coming on to me.",
272,1.0,2.0,Samantha,Do you actually think he believes I'm a model? - You don't want to go there.,
273,1.0,2.0,Carrie,- Why not? He has this thing for secretly taping his conquests.,
274,1.0,2.0,Samantha,Really? What a pervert.,
275,1.0,2.0,Carrie,As Samantha began to get ready for her close-up I felt it was time to call it a night.,
276,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I had never felt so invisible in my entire life.,
277,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Taxi! - Carrie.,
278,1.0,2.0,Derek,"- Hey, hi.",

284,1.0,2.0,Carrie,You wanna come home with me?,
285,1.0,2.0,Derek," Sure, if it's quiet.I can't take these crowds.",
286,1.0,2.0,Carrie,The things you gotta do in the name of research.,
287,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Shouldn't you be spending the night with some girl from the show?,
288,1.0,2.0,Derek," No, I never date models.I think they're stupid.",
289,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I wondered if there wasn't some kind of physics for beauty.,
290,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Maybe two models repelled.,
291,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Maybe models could only be attracted to ordinary humans.,
292,1.0,2.0,Derek,"So, I think it's so cool that you write.",
293,1.0,2.0,Carrie,- Thanks.,
294,1.0,2.0,Derek,- I wish I could write.,
295,1.0,2.0,Derek,"I've got intense thoughts, but I can't keep them in my head long enough to get them down on paper.",
296,1.0,2.0,Carrie,That's the big trick.,
297,1.0,2.0,Derek,"The truth is, I'm totally neurotic.",
298,1.0,2.0,Derek,"One minute I can be walking down the street, totally cool and the next minute I'm depressed for no reason.",
299,1.0,2.0,Derek,I'm totally self-conscious.,
300,1.0,2.0,Derek,"Before I say something, I say it in my head first so it doesn't come out wrong.",
301,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Doesn't that seem like a waste of time? ,
302,1.0,2.0,Derek,It only takes a second.- And sometimes I get so distracted.,
303,1.0,2.0,Carrie,- What's distracting you now?,
304,1.0,2.0,Derek,Your nose.,
305,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Thanks a lot.,
306,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I hate my nose.,
307,1.0,2.0,Derek,It's just so cute.,
308,1.0,2.0,Derek,I hate my nose too.,
309,1.0,2.0,Derek,It's too big.,
310,1.0,2.0,Derek,- But I think it depends on my hair.,
311,1.0,2.0,Carrie,- Yeah.,
312,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I see what you mean.,
313,1.0,2.0,Derek,So what do you want to be when you grow up? ,
314,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"Well, I think this might be it.",
315,1.0,2.0,Carrie,What do you want to be when you grow up? ,
316,1.0,2.0,Derek,I'd like to move back to lowa and have kids and be a cop.,
317,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I felt like I was in my bedroom when I was 16 and I used to hang out with this guy who was really beautiful and my parents thought I was helping him with his chemistry homework.,
318,1.0,2.0,Derek,Do you mind if we just lie here? I get so lonely in the city.,
319,1.0,2.0,Derek,Sometimes it's just nice to lie with someone.,
320,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Sure.,
321,1.0,2.0,Carrie,We could do that.,
322,1.0,2.0,Carrie,It was hard to imagine that anyone so beautiful could ever be lonely.,
323,1.0,2.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, somewhere below 14th Street two ordinary joes were doing their own lonely late-night thing.",
324,1.0,2.0,Counter guy,- Anything else? - ,
325,1.0,2.0,Miranda ,That's it.,
326,1.0,2.0,Counter guy,- Just cat food? - ,
327,1.0,2.0,Miranda,"Yes, just cat food.",
328,1.0,2.0,Miranda,"Oh, hi, Skipper.",
329,1.0,2.0,Skipper,"So like, how come you haven't been returning any of my calls? I'm sorry.",
330,1.0,2.0,Miranda,It's been a really busy week.,
331,1.0,2.0,Skipper,I thought we had a connection.,
332,1.0,2.0,Miranda,I don't know.,
333,1.0,2.0,Miranda,"Could I get my change? No, it's just-- It's got nothing to do with age.",
334,1.0,2.0,Skipper,You get that way with every guy that you're with?,
335,1.0,2.0,Miranda,Don't you wanna go out with a girl your own age?,
336,1.0,2.0,Skipper,I think you're luminous.,
337,1.0,2.0,Miranda,- You think I'm luminous? -,
338,1.0,2.0,Skipper,Totally.,
339,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Miranda couldn't resist the vision of herself reflected in Skipper's slightly smudged lenses.,
340,1.0,2.0,Miranda,"- All right, let's get out of here.",
341,1.0,2.0,Skipper,- Let me just pay f or my Cap'n Crunch.,
342,1.0,2.0,Miranda,There's cereal at my place.,
343,1.0,2.0,Carrie,And Samantha found the ultimate validation: sex with Barkley.,
344,1.0,2.0,Samantha,So where is it? The camera.,
345,1.0,2.0,Barkley,What?,
346,1.0,2.0,Barkley,Your friend Carrie tell you about that? Don't worry.,
347,1.0,2.0,Barkley,I only tape models.,
348,1.0,2.0,Samantha,I won't mind.,
349,1.0,2.0,Barkley,Fine.,
350,1.0,2.0,Barkley,I'll make an exception.,
351,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Samantha demanded nothing less than the same consideration given every other model in town.,
352,1.0,2.0,Satnford,"- Hello? - Carrie, it's Stanford.",
353,1.0,2.0,Stanford,"Do you have any idea what happened to Derek last night? Actually you'll never believe it, but-- Yes? It's Stanford.",

355,1.0,2.0,Stanford,- Derek?  Sure.,
356,1.0,2.0,Stanford,Could you put Carrie back on the phone?,
357,1.0,2.0,Carrie,- Hello.,
358,1.0,2.0,Stanford,- How could you?,
359,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I didn't.,
360,1.0,2.0,Carrie,We just talked.,
361,1.0,2.0,Stanford,I knew he was gay.,
362,1.0,2.0,Nick,It's amazing what you'll do to be with these models.,
363,1.0,2.0,Nick,I've gotta retire soon.,
364,1.0,2.0,Nick,"They keep me from getting work done, they make me fuck up my life.",
365,1.0,2.0,Nick,Look at me! I'm an old man at 34.,
366,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I began to realize that being beautiful is like having a rent-controlled apartment overlooking the park: completely unfair and usually bestowed upon those who deserve it least.,
367,1.0,2.0,Big,"I'm not interrupting your work, am l? Hey, what a surprise.",
368,1.0,2.0,Big,I can't stay.,
369,1.0,2.0,Big,I'm late for a meeting.,
370,1.0,2.0,Big,But I've been thinking about your article about men who date models.,

372,1.0,2.0,Big ,"First of all, there are so many goddamn gorgeous women in this city.",
373,1.0,2.0,Carrie,What an amazing observation.,
374,1.0,2.0,Big,But the thing is this.,
375,1.0,2.0,Big,After a while you just wanna be with the one that makes you laugh.,
376,1.0,2.0,Big,Know what I mean? Okay.,
377,1.0,2.0,Carrie,See ya.,
378,1.0,2.0,Carrie,I take that back.,
379,1.0,2.0,Carrie,Beauty is fleeting but a rent-controlled apartment overlooking the park is forever.,
0,1.0,3.0,Carrie,One of the best things about living in a city like New York is leaving it.,

34,1.0,3.0,Carrie,I'm confused.,
35,1.0,3.0,Samantha,Why would he do that? Did he want to have sex with you? I don't know.,
36,1.0,3.0,Carrie,It didn't feel sexual.,
37,1.0,3.0,Samantha,Maybe we wanted to show it off.,
38,1.0,3.0,Samantha,Like a monkey.,
39,1.0,3.0,Samantha,"- So how big was it? - Fresh pepper? Yes, please.",

132,1.0,3.0,Miranda,I'm not gay.,
133,1.0,3.0,Jeff,Seriously? I've been with the firm eight months.,
134,1.0,3.0,Jeff,I haven't once seen you with a guy.,
135,1.0,3.0,Miranda,"Circumstantial, Jeff.",
136,1.0,3.0,Miranda,I'm single.,
137,1.0,3.0,Miranda,Christ! When did being single translate into being gay? Shit.,
138,1.0,3.0,Jeff,"You want me to go over there-- No, I'll do it.",
139,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Brave Miranda marched right over and told Syd she wasn't.,
140,1.0,3.0,Carrie,They had a good laugh and decided to stay and play ball.,
141,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Miranda and Syd's last-inning double play got the attention of everyone even the firm's senior partner.,
142,1.0,3.0,Chip,"- That was quite a play, ladies.",
143,1.0,3.0,Miranda,"- It's all about teamwork, Charles.",
144,1.0,3.0,Chip,- Chip.,
145,1.0,3.0,Miranda,- Chip.,
146,1.0,3.0,Chip,My wife and I are having a dinner party on the 12th.,
147,1.0,3.0,Chip,"Just some couples, nothing fancy.",
148,1.0,3.0,Chip,We'd love it if you both could make it.,
149,1.0,3.0,Miranda,We'd love to.,
150,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Later that night, Miranda gave me the lowdown on her day.",
151,1.0,3.0,Carrie,So you think it's just because they think you're in a couple? I know it.,
152,1.0,3.0,Miranda,I've been with the firm for two years.,
153,1.0,3.0,Miranda,He's barely spoken to me.,
154,1.0,3.0,Miranda,"All of a sudden, it's ""Chip.",
155,1.0,3.0,Carrie,""" A lawyer named Chip.",
156,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Gotta love that.,
157,1.0,3.0,Miranda,And they seemed so relieved to have finally figured me out.,
158,1.0,3.0,Carrie,So you're going to the dinner? Yup.,
159,1.0,3.0,Miranda,I'm determined to make partner in this firm even if I have to be a lesbian partner.,
160,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"After Miranda left, I had a thought.",
161,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Maybe the cold war isn't about hate.,
162,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Maybe it's about fear, fear of the unknown.",
163,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Married people don't hate singles.,
164,1.0,3.0,Carrie,They just want us figured out.,
165,1.0,3.0,Carrie,I felt it was time to stop all the speculation and infiltrate the enemy camp.,
166,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Lunch with my favorite couple, David and Lisa.",
167,1.0,3.0,David,"Well, I don't think of us as married so much as together.",
168,1.0,3.0,Lisa,- Wait.,
169,1.0,3.0,Lisa,Are we married? - Yeah.,
170,1.0,3.0,David,"Remember that day you wore the white dress and we got all the flatware? Oh, yeah.",
171,1.0,3.0,Lisa,I guess I should stop seeing other men.,
172,1.0,3.0,David,What about you? You like being single?,
173,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Most of the time, yeah.",
174,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Then there are the other times.,
175,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Like family functions when you're the only one that's not married and they sit you at the kid's table.,
176,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Or when you two eat off the same fork, I just-- Oh, man, that's so sweet.",
177,1.0,3.0,Lisa,Don't start crying.,
178,1.0,3.0,Lisa,He's such a pussy.,
179,1.0,3.0,David,"But you do want to get married someday, right? I don't know.",
180,1.0,3.0,Carrie,I'm beginning to think I may not be the marrying kind.,
181,1.0,3.0,Lisa,Really?,
182,1.0,3.0,Carrie, No sooner had the words come out of my mouth than I wondered if they were true.,
183,1.0,3.0,David,"Hey, Sean! What a surprise! This is our friend Carrie.",
184,1.0,3.0,David,We just about to have dessert.,
185,1.0,3.0,Lisa,Want to join us? ,
186,1.0,3.0,Sean,Sure.,
187,1.0,3.0,Lisa,This is such a surprise.,
188,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Another time I hate being single is when married friends ""surprise"" fix you up.",
189,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Two espressos and a tiramisu later I had learned that Sean was the youngest of three brothers had his own investment firm and was about to move into an apartment he had just purchased.,x
190,1.0,3.0,Sean,"- You know this was a fix-up, right? - ",
191,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Oh, please.I could smell it before you walked in the door.",
192,1.0,3.0,Sean,My parents met on a fix-up and they will be married Wow.,
193,1.0,3.0,Carrie,That's great.,
194,1.0,3.0,Carrie,It was then I realized I was having coffee with the marrying guy.,
195,1.0,3.0,Carrie,That elusive and rare Manhattan man whose sights were set on marriage.,
196,1.0,3.0,Sean,"So, Carrie, can I see you again? Sure.",
197,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Over the next week and a half, I met Sean for a movie I met him for another movie and I helped him pick out a top of the line cheese grater at Williams-Sonoma.",
198,1.0,3.0,Sean,My buddies are giving me a big housewarming on the 12th.,
199,1.0,3.0,Sean,-You should come and bring your friends.,
200,1.0,3.0,Carrie,-Sounds like fun.,
201,1.0,3.0,Sean,Thanks for a great day.,
202,1.0,3.0,Carrie,He was like the flesh-and-blood equivalent of a DKNY dress.,
203,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"You know it's not your style, but it's right there so you try it on anyway.",
204,1.0,3.0,Carrie,It was the night of the 12th.,
205,1.0,3.0,Carrie,On the East Side a pseudo-lesbian couple attended a right-wing Republican dinner party.,
206,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"On the West Side, a trio of single gals went to a single guy's housewarming party.",
207,1.0,3.0,Charlotte,- So are his friends cute? -,
208,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Don't know.,
209,1.0,3.0,Carrie,I haven't met them yet.,
210,1.0,3.0,Charlotte,How did you manage to get a new boyfriend in a week? He's not my boyfriend.,
211,1.0,3.0,Carrie,He's just somebody I'm trying on.,
212,1.0,3.0,Carrie,All right.,
213,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Ready? Everywhere I looked, people were standing in twos.",
214,1.0,3.0,Carrie,It was like Noah's Upper West Side rent controlled ark.,
215,1.0,3.0,Samantha,It's all married couples.,
216,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Samantha gave me a look like I had sold her to the enemy for chocolate bars and nylons.,
217,1.0,3.0,Carrie,- This is for you.,
218,1.0,3.0,Sean,- Thank you.,
219,1.0,3.0,Sean,You must be Charlotte.,

226,1.0,3.0,Sean,- I've been planning it for years.,
227,1.0,3.0,Sean,I'll give you the grand tour.,
228,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"As I moved through the married couples, I noticed something was different.",
229,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"No fear, no pity, no pointing.",
230,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Were Sean's friends cold war conscientious objectors or was it just that I was ""figured out""? My accountant says that it's best to go with low-risk stocks.",
231,1.0,3.0,Married guy,That depends.,
232,1.0,3.0,Samantha,"What are your expectations? Well, I'm not sure.",
233,1.0,3.0,Married woman2,"Honey, I need you to come over here and meet someone.",
234,1.0,3.0,Married Guy,Sure.,

250,1.0,3.0,Samantha,"Oh, my God.",
251,1.0,3.0,Carrie,You're doing tequila shots? You see that buddy over there? I fucked him.,
252,1.0,3.0,Samantha,See that buddy over there? I fucked him too.,
253,1.0,3.0,Samantha,I never thought I'd see them again.,
254,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Maybe we should start tagging your married men and that way you can keep track of them.,
255,1.0,3.0,Charlotte,- He's gonna ask you to marry him.,
256,1.0,3.0,Carrie,- He is not.,

283,1.0,3.0,Samantha,"Big pepper mill dick! And just as suddenly, our little cease-fire was over.",
284,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, across town things were winding down.",
285,1.0,3.0,Miranda,Thank you so much.,
286,1.0,3.0,Miranda,We really had a great time.,

298,1.0,3.0,Miranda,"- Thank you, sir.",
299,1.0,3.0,Miranda,My wife will be disappointed.,
300,1.0,3.0,Chip,She was looking to add a lesbian couple to our circle.,
301,1.0,3.0,Carrie,As they rode between floors Miranda considered how much easier her life would be if she were in a couple.,
302,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Any couple.,
303,1.0,3.0,Miranda,Yep.,
304,1.0,3.0,Miranda,Definitely straight.,
305,1.0,3.0,Syd,Yeah.,
306,1.0,3.0,Syd,You are.,
307,1.0,3.0,Miranda,Sorry.,
308,1.0,3.0,Carrie,While Miranda cursed her heterosexuality and wondered how much longer she could fight the war Charlotte cursed tequila and forced Samantha into a cab.,
309,1.0,3.0,Carrie,She decided Samantha was too drunk to get home alone and insisted she spend the night on her couch.,
310,1.0,3.0,Door Man,Let me get that door for you.,
311,1.0,3.0,Charlotte,- All right.,
312,1.0,3.0,Samantha,- I like him.,
313,1.0,3.0,Carrie,She got Samantha upstairs and safely to bed.,

315,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"A couple of hours later, Samantha woke up still drunk and still single.",
316,1.0,3.0,Carrie,And single to Samantha meant one thing.,

324,1.0,3.0,Door Man,I'm just leaving.,
325,1.0,3.0,Door Man,Your friend invited me up.,
326,1.0,3.0,Door Man,I know it was wrong.,
327,1.0,3.0,Door Man,But I've been so lonely since I left home and I wanted the feel of a woman's touch on me.,
328,1.0,3.0,Charlotte,"I'm going into the bathroom now and when I come out, you won't be here.",
329,1.0,3.0,Charlotte,And I never want this mentioned again.,
330,1.0,3.0,Door Man,"Let me get the door for you, miss.",
331,1.0,3.0,Sean,I was hoping you'd stay over.,
332,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Look, Sean I don't think this is gonna work.",
333,1.0,3.0,Carrie,We want different things.,
334,1.0,3.0,Carrie,You obviously want to get married and I don't know what I want.,

336,1.0,3.0,Carrie,You know? See if it fit.,
337,1.0,3.0,Carrie,It doesn't.,
338,1.0,3.0,Carrie,I'm sorry.,
339,1.0,3.0,Sean,I don't understand you women.,

345,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Who? They started out casual-- a brunch here, a concert there.",
346,1.0,3.0,Carrie,But pretty soon they were visiting china.,
347,1.0,3.0,Sean,I always wanted this pattern for formal dining.,
348,1.0,3.0,Charlotte,Are you serious? ,

354,1.0,3.0,Charlotte,I don't know.,
355,1.0,3.0,Carrie,As I sifted through the rubble of my marriage skirmish I had a thought.,
356,1.0,3.0,Carrie,Maybe the fight between marrieds and singles is like the war in Northern lreland.,
357,1.0,3.0,Carrie,We're all basically the same but somehow we wound up on different sides.,
358,1.0,3.0,Carrie,"Sure, it'd be great to have that one special person to walk home with but sometimes there's nothing better than meeting your single girlfriends for a night at the movies.",

22,1.0,5.0,Samantha,She cannot do this to us.,
23,1.0,5.0,Samantha,- We're leaving.,
24,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Oh, God.",
25,1.0,5.0,Samantha,Let me tell you something.,
26,1.0,5.0,Samantha,I was that woman ten years ago but I wielded my power in a benevolent manner.,
27,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Can we please talk about this over lunch somewhere else? ,
28,1.0,5.0,Samantha,"Where, somewhere like New Jersey, where we might actually get seated? Do you realize, if she were a man, not only would we be eating now but they'd be sending over free drinks.",
29,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I know a great Thai place around the corner where the owner's son practically always sends over a complementary order of mee krob.,
30,1.0,5.0,Samantha,How sad.,
31,1.0,5.0,Samantha,"Do you think we can get it to go? A short time later, Samantha headed back to her office while I decided to investigate this theory I had about shopping as a way ",
32,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"A short time later, Samantha headed back to her office while I decided to investigate this theory I had about shopping as a way to unleash the creative subconscious. to unleash the cre",
33,1.0,5.0,Carrie,All right.,
34,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm gonna take them.,
35,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I was already planning on returning them when-- ,
36,1.0,5.0,Store Clerk,Miss? They told me to do that.,
37,1.0,5.0,Store Clerk,And now they want to talk to you.,
38,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- That won't be necessary.,
39,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Oh, my God! I don't believe it! - When did you get to town? - Just yesterday.",
40,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"- Darling, you look fantastic.",
41,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- I can't let you do this.,
42,1.0,5.0,Amalita,Of course you can.,
43,1.0,5.0,Amalita,And you can pay me back never.,
44,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"Besides, it's on Carlo.",
45,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Wow.,
46,1.0,5.0,Amalita,When did you two-- About two months.,
47,1.0,5.0,Amalita,His family has this gigantic ranch in Argentina.,
48,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"Very, very wealthy.",
49,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"He has a tiny little penis, but he knows exactly how to use it.",
50,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"Wave, darling.",
51,1.0,5.0,Amalita,Wave.,
52,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"Ciao, ciao, ciao.",
53,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"That's very nice of you, but I just can't accept these.",
54,1.0,5.0,Amalita,But of course you can.,
55,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"When have I ever given you a birthday present or a Christmas present? I mean, you are like a sister to me yet I never see you.",
56,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"The truth was, we'd only met a f ew times.",
57,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Most people would classify Amalita as Eurotrash.,
58,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I thought she was fun.,
59,1.0,5.0,Amalita,So call me.,
60,1.0,5.0,Amalita,I'm staying at the Four Seasons with Carlo.,
61,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- Don't you live in the city? - I'm a citizen of the world.,
62,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"A citizen of the world, darling.",
63,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"Now take the shoes, and we'll talk soon.",
64,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- I can't do this.,
65,1.0,5.0,Amalita,- Of course you can.,
66,1.0,5.0,Aam,"- Go, go.",
67,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- Thank you.,
68,1.0,5.0,Amalita,I couldn't understand a word she was saying but I f elt I had in my possession all the ltalian I'd ever need to know.,
69,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"While at home, all the English I seemed to encounter was ""bills, bills, bills.",
70,1.0,5.0,Carrie,""" I envied Amalita.",
71,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"Her lif e was a blur of rich men, designer clothes and glamorous resorts.",
72,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"She didn't actually work f or a living, yet possessed a dazzling sexual power that she exploited to her full advantage.",
73,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Which presented a certain conundrum.,
74,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Where's the line between prof essional girlfriend and just plain prof essional? Women have the right to use every means at their disposal to achieve power.,
75,1.0,5.0,Samantha,Short of sleeping their way to the top.,
76,1.0,5.0,Miranda,Not if that's what it takes to compete.,
77,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,But that's exploitation! ,
78,1.0,5.0,Samantha,Of men-- which is perf ectly legal.,
79,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Saturday night.,
80,1.0,5.0,Carrie,In an eff ort to save money and maybe even pick up a f ew extra bucks I invited the girls over f or poker.,
81,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,- I'll buy two.,
82,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- I'm in f or three.,
83,1.0,5.0,Carrie,So you advocate a double standard.,
84,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Women can use their sexuality to get ahead whenever possible but men should not be allowed to take advantage of it? I'm just saying that men and women are equal-opportunity exploiters.,
85,1.0,5.0,Miranda,- I f old.,
86,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- What if you sense that someone is giving you a prof essional advantage because they find you charming? - Charming? - This I gotta hear.,
87,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,"A f ew days ago, Neville Morgan, the notoriously reclusive painter paid a visit to the gallery.",
88,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Neville was making his yearly pilgrimage to Manhattan to check out what was new and hot on the art scene.,
89,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,And he f ound it-- Charlotte.,
90,1.0,5.0,Carrie,It was only a matter of moments bef ore he invited her to his f arm upstate to view his latest work.,
91,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,"If I could get him to show at the gallery, it would be an incredible coup.",
92,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,"- But what if he wants me to, you know.",
93,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- Hold his brush? If he so much as suggests what she's suggesting you give me a call and we'll sue the hell out of him.,
94,1.0,5.0,Miranda,That's the only proper way to trade sex f or power.,
95,1.0,5.0,Samantha,I can't believe what I'm hearing.,
96,1.0,5.0,Samantha,You're like the Harvard Law Lorena Bobbitt.,
97,1.0,5.0,Miranda,It's Skipper.,
98,1.0,5.0,Miranda,I told him I was here.,
99,1.0,5.0,Miranda,"He insisted on picking me up, but he's not supposed to be here till 11:00.",
100,1.0,5.0,Carrie,He's like a sweet little seal pup.,
101,1.0,5.0,Miranda,That you sometimes want to club.,
102,1.0,5.0,Miranda,You're an hour early.,
103,1.0,5.0,Skipper,I can wait in the hall.,
104,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"Skipper, come in.",
105,1.0,5.0,Miranda,It's all right.,
106,1.0,5.0,Miranda,I'm leaving anyway.,
107,1.0,5.0,Miranda,You guys have cleaned me out.,
108,1.0,5.0,Miranda,"Good night, ladies.",
109,1.0,5.0,Miranda,Keep me posted.,
110,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"A couple of hours later, I was looking f orward to calling it an early night, when-- -  ",
111,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"Hello? - Carrie, you bitch! What are you doing? -",
112,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm getting ready to go to sleep.,
113,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"- Why don't you come and join us? We are at Balzac, and there is someone here I am dying f or you to meet.",
114,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"I'd love to, but I'm really trying to cut back.",
115,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"You know, pinch a f ew pennies.",
116,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"You are crazy, you know that? Why don't you just come down here and be your f abulous self? The truth was I could barely aff ord that either.",
117,1.0,5.0,Carrie,But I rationalized that my new shoes shouldn't be punished just because I can't budget.,
118,1.0,5.0,Hostess,Sorry.,
119,1.0,5.0,Hostess,You're not on the list.,
120,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I don't need a list.,
121,1.0,5.0,Carrie,My friends are already in.,
122,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"Darling, what took you so long? You won't believe what Carlo bought me this afternoon at Van Cleef & Arpels.",
123,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"What? Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.",
124,1.0,5.0,Amalita,Twelve thousand dollars.,
125,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"Listen, I want you to come and meet the world's most f abulous man.",
126,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Sounds like a trendy sideshow act.,
127,1.0,5.0,Amalita,"You're crazy! Carrie, I'd like you to meet my boyfriend Carlo.",
128,1.0,5.0,Amalita,- And his friend Gilles.,
129,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- Hello.,
130,1.0,5.0,Carlo,Hello.,
131,1.0,5.0,Giles,Nice to meet you.,
132,1.0,5.0,Amalita,Gilles is an architect from Paris.,x
133,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- How long are you here f or? -.,
134,1.0,5.0,Giles,Just a couple of days,
135,1.0,5.0,Giles,On business.,
136,1.0,5.0,Amalita,I've told Gilles all about you.,
137,1.0,5.0,Amalita,I told him you were the most beautiful talented and f ascinating woman in New York.,
138,1.0,5.0,Amalita,And single.,
139,1.0,5.0,Giles,How is this possible? I get it.,
140,1.0,5.0,Carrie,You're an architect and a comedian.,
141,1.0,5.0,Giles,I don't understand.,
142,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Nothing.,
143,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm just being un peu stupide.,
144,1.0,5.0,Giles,You? Never.,
145,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I suddenly recalled my terrible weakness f or gorgeous French architects.,
146,1.0,5.0,Giles,Can I get anyone something else? You would like another bottle of wine? Wonderful.,
147,1.0,5.0,Carrie,And what will the rest of you be having? ,
148,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"During the next couple of hours, I put my journalistic skills to good use.",
149,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"I discovered that Gilles was recently divorced with a five-year-old daughter, Beatrice who lived with her mother in Paris.",
150,1.0,5.0,Carrie,He was passing through New York on his way to Brazil to supervise construction of a new hotel.,
151,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I think you are too beautiful to be a writer.,
152,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I think you're too charming to be an architect.,
153,1.0,5.0,Giles,I think you should give up your lif e here and move with me to Paris immediately.,
154,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I thought you were spending the next six months in Brazil.,
155,1.0,5.0,Giles,You can join me there first.,
156,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Don't tempt me.,
157,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm so broke these days I might take you up on that off er just to save on rent.,
158,1.0,5.0,Giles,"Writing does not pay well? No, it does.",
159,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"It's just, I have this little substance abuse problem.",
160,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Expensive f ootwear.,
161,1.0,5.0,Giles,I see.,
162,1.0,5.0,Giles,I'm only here f or the weekend but I would love to see you tomorrow.,
163,1.0,5.0,Giles,Maybe you could show me the town.,
164,1.0,5.0,Giles,You've never been to New York? About 12 times but I've never seen it with someone like you.,
165,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"You really have that certain je ne sais quoi, don't you? Yes.",
166,1.0,5.0,Giles,And so do you.,
167,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"So, I'll see you tomorrow.",
168,1.0,5.0,Giles,Good night.,
169,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"Sure, I saw some red flags-- divorced, French and almost uncomf ortably handsome-- but I f elt like I was floating on air.",
170,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"The next morning I was brought back down to Earth as I confronted that eternal puzzle a closet full of clothes, nothing to wear.",
171,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Just a minute! Who is it? - Hey.,
172,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- Hey.,
173,1.0,5.0,Skipper,I'm sorry.,
174,1.0,5.0,Skipper,I should go.,
175,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"Skipper, come on in.",
176,1.0,5.0,Skipper,What is it? It's Miranda.,
177,1.0,5.0,Skipper,She's got me totally whacked.,
178,1.0,5.0,Skipper,It's like I'm obsessed.,
179,1.0,5.0,Skipper,And I know that I shouldn't be because I can sense that it's totally turning her off.,
180,1.0,5.0,Skipper,But I can't control it.,
181,1.0,5.0,Skipper,I can't.,
182,1.0,5.0,Skipper,It's like she's got this power over me and I'm helpless.,
183,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Keep going.,
184,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"I have to get dressed, all right? Is it possible to be addicted to a person? The sex is so awesome that it's, like it's all I can think about.",
185,1.0,5.0,Skipper,I've never considered myself a horn dog bef ore but I'm worried I might be starting to scare her off.,
186,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"Well, is that what she said?",
187,1.0,5.0,Skipper,"No, but mostly we just have sex in the afternoon.",
188,1.0,5.0,Skipper,She never lets me spend the night.,
189,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"Well, I have an idea.",
190,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Why don't the two of you just spend a night together and not have sex? That would be hard.,
191,1.0,5.0,Skipper,That would be really hard.,
192,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"Well, I think it's really important that you try.",
193,1.0,5.0,Skipper,I don't even shower afterwards.,
194,1.0,5.0,Skipper,I like to spend the whole day smelling like Miranda.,
195,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I began to f ear that Miranda's sexuality was overpowering poor Skipper.,
196,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Later I spent the most incredibly romantic afternoon with Gilles.,
197,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I f elt like I had landed in a Claude Lelouch film-- A Man and a Slightly Neurotic Woman.,
198,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Wait.,
199,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Wait.,
200,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I kind of have this rule.,
201,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I don't sleep with men I've only known a day.,
202,1.0,5.0,Giles,I see.,
203,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I gave in.,
204,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"After all, it was already tomorrow in Paris.",
205,1.0,5.0,Giles,You look so beautiful when you sleep.,
206,1.0,5.0,Giles,I didn't want to disturb you.,
207,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- Are you leaving so early? -,
208,1.0,5.0,Giles,I've got a plane.,
209,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I'll get up.,
210,1.0,5.0,Giles,Stay in bed.,
211,1.0,5.0,Giles,Order room service.,
212,1.0,5.0,Giles,Enjoy yourself.,
213,1.0,5.0,Carrie,- I can just get dressed.,
214,1.0,5.0,Giles,- Relax.,
215,1.0,5.0,Giles,I'll call you.,
216,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Okay.,
217,1.0,5.0,Giles,"As he walked out the door, it suddenly dawned on me that he didn't have my phone number.",
218,1.0,5.0,Giles,And I didn't have his phone number.,
219,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"But he had left me a note with $1,000 in cash.",
220,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"""Thanks f or the beautiful day.",
221,1.0,5.0,Miranda,""" Must have been a hell of a beautiful day.",
222,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"Well, it was.",
223,1.0,5.0,Carrie,We had such a f antastic connection.,
224,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Then he leaves me money.,
225,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I don't understand.,
226,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"What exactly about me screams ""whore""? I just can't believe that you had dinner at Balzac.",
227,1.0,5.0,Miranda,"Besides the $1,000 on the end table?",
228,1.0,5.0,Samantha,Wait a minute.,
229,1.0,5.0,Samantha,I thought I ordered two eggs benedict and one spinach omelette.,
230,1.0,5.0,Miranda,It's all right.,
231,1.0,5.0,Miranda,I'll take the omelette.,
232,1.0,5.0,Carrie,This isn't right.,
233,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"We're gonna pay f or all this ourselves, all right? He said order anything.",
234,1.0,5.0,Miranda,"The room service is one thing, but the money-- uh-uh.",
235,1.0,5.0,Samantha,What are you getting so uptight about? Money is power.,
236,1.0,5.0,Samantha,Sex is power.,
237,1.0,5.0,Samantha,"Theref ore, getting money f or sex is simply an exchange of power.",
238,1.0,5.0,Miranda,Don't listen to the dime store Camille Paglia.,
239,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I don't know whether to take it as an incredible compliment or as an incredible insult.,
240,1.0,5.0,Samantha,"Just take it, period.",
241,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I wouldn't know how to return it anyway because he didn't leave me his number.,
242,1.0,5.0,Miranda,He paid in full.,
243,1.0,5.0,Miranda,"What more is there to talk about? Who is this Amalita Amalfi character, anyway? I'm concerned that you've been drafted into a ring of high-class hookers.",
244,1.0,5.0,Carrie,She isn't a hooker.,
245,1.0,5.0,Carrie,She's-- She's like an international party girl.,
246,1.0,5.0,Miranda,She's a hooker with a passport.,
247,1.0,5.0,Miranda,Do you ever have any conversations about money? ,
248,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I did allude to the f act that I was a bit cash poor these days.,
249,1.0,5.0,Miranda,So maybe it's supposed to be a loan? I don't remember filling out an application.,
250,1.0,5.0,Samantha,"Sweetheart, men give, women receive.",
251,1.0,5.0,Samantha,- It's biological destiny.,
252,1.0,5.0,Miranda,- Do you really want to say that? That's the argument men have used since the dawn of time to exploit women.,
253,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm just gonna write the whole thing off as a bad date with a cash bonus.,
254,1.0,5.0,Miranda,"You know, that salmon is really good.",
255,1.0,5.0,Miranda,I think we should order another one.,
256,1.0,5.0,Carrie,As I struggled with the dilemma of how to manage my newf ound money Charlotte arrived at the secluded Connecticut home of the painter Neville Morgan in an attempt to secure his latest work.,
257,1.0,5.0,Neville,Welcome.,
258,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,Hi.,
259,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,I f eel so privileged.,
260,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,Meeting you is without a doubt the high point of my career.,
261,1.0,5.0,Neville,Thank you.,
262,1.0,5.0,Neville,I'm frankly surprised that someone as young as you is even familiar with my work.,
263,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,Are you serious? I studied you in college.,
264,1.0,5.0,Neville,"Oh, my God.",
265,1.0,5.0,Neville,I apologize.,
266,1.0,5.0,Neville,- I really do.,
267,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,- You're much too modest.,
268,1.0,5.0,Neville,Here we are.,
269,1.0,5.0,Neville,Excuse me.,
270,1.0,5.0,Neville,The canvasses you're about to see are what I consider to be the apotheosis of every great idea I've ever had.,
271,1.0,5.0,Neville,"It's the closest I've ever come to pure, universal God f orce.",
272,1.0,5.0,Neville,The cunt.,
273,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,"Oh, my.",
274,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,They're very powerful.,
275,1.0,5.0,Neville,Exactly.,
276,1.0,5.0,Neville,The most powerful f orce in the universe.,
277,1.0,5.0,Neville,The source of all lif e and pleasure and beauty.,
278,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,That's true.,
279,1.0,5.0,Neville,I used to paint full nudes but as I got older I realized that the truth was to be f ound only in the cunt.,
280,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"Charlotte hated the ""C"" word.",
281,1.0,5.0,Carrie,But Neville Morgan was not a man to be corrected.,
282,1.0,5.0,Neville wife,Hi.,
283,1.0,5.0,Neville wife,I thought you might like something to drink.,
284,1.0,5.0,Neville,"Charlotte, this is my wif e, Gertrude.",
285,1.0,5.0,Gertrude,It's a pleasure.,
286,1.0,5.0,Gertrude,- Lemonade and cookies? - Thank you.,
287,1.0,5.0,Neville,Each of these portraits is of a woman who has touched my lif e.,
288,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,Incredible.,
289,1.0,5.0,Neville,I wonder would you consider posing f or me sometime? ,
290,1.0,5.0,Charlotte,Me? l-- Well I'm very flattered.,
291,1.0,5.0,Neville,Excellent.,
292,1.0,5.0,Neville,"So long as you're here, I could sketch you this afternoon.",
293,1.0,5.0,Gertrude,"I bet you have a beautiful cunt, dear.",
294,1.0,5.0,Carrie,As Charlotte pondered how f ar she would go f or her love of art and the gallery-- Another Saturday night.,
295,1.0,5.0,Carrie,With my hooker money still burning a hole in my pocket Samantha and I showed up at Balzac.,
296,1.0,5.0,Carrie,She reasoned that since I was there once I was as good as in.,
297,1.0,5.0,Samantha,I don't understand.,
298,1.0,5.0,Samantha,"I made these reservations weeks ago, and she's already been here.",
299,1.0,5.0,Hostess,I'm sorry.,
300,1.0,5.0,Samantha,Is there a host that I might talk to? I will snap her.,
301,1.0,5.0,Samantha,"I will put her over my knee, and I will snap her like a twig.",
302,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm sorry.,

320,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I couldn't say I wasn't tempted.,
321,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I realized that I could leverage myself Iike the human equivalent of a sexy junk bond.,
322,1.0,5.0,Carrie,"I'd parlay that $1,000 into a trip to Venice into a nice piece of jewelry a rich husband, f ollowed by a richer divorce.",
323,1.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm sorry.,

329,1.0,5.0,Amalita,I'm staying at the Carlyle with Peter.,
330,1.0,5.0,Carrie,Just because Venice was sinking didn't mean my morals had to go down with it.,

2,1.0,6.0,Photographer,"Good, good.",
3,1.0,6.0,Carrie,It was a promotional photo for my column scheduled to run on the side of a bus.,
4,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I had misgivings which were somewhat mollified when they told me I could keep the dress.,
5,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Friday night.,
6,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"In lieu of any actual social life of their own Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte had all stopped by to live vicariously through my first official date with Mr.",

24,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,I thought you were serious about this guy.,
25,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,You can't sleep with him on the first date.,
26,1.0,6.0,Miranda,"Here she goes again with ""The Rules.",
27,1.0,6.0,Samantha,""" The women who wrote that book wrote it because they couldn't get laid so they constructed this whole bullshit theory to make women who can get laid feel bad.",
28,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,"But if you're serious about a guy, then you have to keep him in a holding pattern for at least five dates.",
29,1.0,6.0,Carrie,- You've gone up.,
30,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,- Yes because the number of dates you wait to have sex with a man is directly proportional to your age.,
31,1.0,6.0,Miranda,Forget the math.,
32,1.0,6.0,Miranda,"Just don't fuck on a first date, you're fine.",
33,1.0,6.0,Carrie,- Third date.,

35,1.0,6.0,Samantha,Reality check.,
36,1.0,6.0,Samantha,A guy can just as easily dump you if you fuck him on the first date as he can if you wait until the tenth.,
37,1.0,6.0,Miranda,When have you ever been on a tenth date?,
38,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,"And by then, at least you're emotionally involved.",
39,1.0,6.0,Samantha,"I mean, isn't it better to find out if the sex is good right offthe bat before anybody's feelings get hurt? - ",
40,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,It's okay to have hurt feelings.,
41,1.0,6.0,Miranda,- And you always handle those so well.,
42,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Well, there is something to be said for restraint.",
43,1.0,6.0,Miranda,- When did you become such a Victorian? - ,
44,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,The Victorians were onto something.,
45,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,They valued romance.,
46,1.0,6.0,Miranda,True romance cannot exist without good sex.,
47,1.0,6.0,Samantha,And yet you can have good sex with someone you don't like or respect or even remember.,
48,1.0,6.0,Carrie,All right.,
49,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Well, ladies, I'm just going to dinner.",
50,1.0,6.0,Carrie,- Good night.,
51,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,- Bye! Have fun! Bye! ,

59,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I can't be hemmed in by rules.,
60,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I go with my emotions.,
61,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Some of the greatest romances of all time began with sex on the first date.,
62,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I bet.,
63,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I will not be the first one to speak.,
64,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"And if he never calls me again, I'll always think of him fondly as an asshole.",
65,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"That was really-- I mean, can you believe we-- on the first date? I mean, I didn't plan that, you know? l-- - What do you think? - ",
66,1.0,6.0,Big,"What? Ow! I thought it was pretty fuckin' great, but what do I know? You feel like getting some Szechuan? Had Mr.",
67,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Big discovered my weakness for great sex and greasy Chinese? Or was going out to dinner simply a diversionary tactic to keep me from spending the night? Before I was able to completely indulge my paranoia it was my pal Mike Singer.,
68,1.0,6.0,Carrie,We've known each other for ten years but never had sex because we want to know each other f or another ten years.,
69,1.0,6.0,Mike,- What are you doing here? -,

80,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Great.,
81,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Well, have a good dinner.",
82,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Nice to meet you.,
83,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I left the table wondering why Mike didn't want to introduce me to his date.,
84,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Again! That very same night, something absolutely amazing happened to Miranda.",

101,1.0,6.0,Mi,- No.,
102,1.0,6.0,Miranda,It's too quick.,

105,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Too quick is sleeping with him on the first date.,

122,1.0,6.0,Carrie,So how long have you been seeing her? ,
123,1.0,6.0,Mike,A while.Is this a painful topic? ,

131,1.0,6.0,Mike,She's just not the one I see myself with.,

134,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"They had both loved to cook, and shopping was a Saturday morning ritual.",

144,1.0,6.0,Libby,It's a triple cream from France.,
145,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Mike found himself very uninhibited.,
146,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Since he didn't think Libby was that gorgeous there wasn't any pressure.,
147,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"The next morning, he woke up and felt at ease very relaxed.",

154,1.0,6.0,Mike,"I mean, most of her friends are in dairy.",
155,1.0,6.0,Mike,But she's warm and unpretentious and it was the best sex I've ever had in my life.,
156,1.0,6.0,Carrie,What are you afraid of? What are other people going to think? All I know is that she's not the right woman for me in the larger sense so I keep her a secret.,
157,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I couldn't decide whether Mike was being shallow or honest but the question nagged me for days.,
158,1.0,6.0,Mike,How many of us out there are having great sex with people we're ashamed to introduce to our friends? ,
159,1.0,6.0,Samantha,Have I ever had fabulous sex with someone I didn't want to admit to? Did I ever tell you about that jazz musician who lived with his mother? - ,

186,1.0,6.0,Samantha,You are going to be on the side of a bus.,
187,1.0,6.0,Samantha,Ten million men are going to be drooling over you on their way to work.,
188,1.0,6.0,Samantha,It's the best personal ad I've ever seen in my life.,
189,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Samantha had a particular knack for turning a desperate situation into a hopeless one.,
190,1.0,6.0,Samantha,Speaking of secret sex did Charlotte ever tell you about the rabbi? The rabbi? - ,
191,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,I cannot believe the two of you came down here to interrogate me at work.,

217,1.0,6.0,Carrie,- I promise.,
218,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Was secret sex the ultimate form of intimacy since it existed in a pure state exempt from the judgment of the world? Or is it just another way in which we deny our feelings and emotionally compartmentalize our lives? - ,

257,1.0,6.0,Big,Cheers.,
258,1.0,6.0,Carrie,- Who was that? - Just some guy I skied with in Aspen.,
259,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I didn't understand.,
260,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Had I suddenly become the invisible woman? I tried not to let it bother me.,
261,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I also tried not to let it bother me that he took me back to Fung Wa scene of our postcoital dinner.,
262,1.0,6.0,Big,"Oh, I can't make your party tomorrow.",
263,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Oh, no.",
264,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I wanted to introduce you to some of my friends.,
265,1.0,6.0,Big,"Well, I'll be home later if you miss me.",
266,1.0,6.0,Carrie,As I surveyed the room I realized it smelled like a cheap date you don't want anyone to meet.,
267,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I told Mr.,
268,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Big I was on a deadline and I had to get home.,
269,1.0,6.0,Carrie,- Hello? - Listen.,
270,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I have a question.,
271,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Of all the restaurants in Manhattan, why did you take Libby to Fung Wa?.",
272,1.0,6.0,Mike,"Well, it's pretty obscure",
273,1.0,6.0,Mike,There's not much of a chance of running into anybody I know.,
274,1.0,6.0,Carrie,You mean it's the kind of place men take women they don't want to be seen with in public? Yes.,
275,1.0,6.0,Mike,It is perfect for that.,
276,1.0,6.0,Mike,- Sorry.,
277,1.0,6.0,Carrie,- The evidence was mounting.,
278,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Was it possible that I had become Mr.,
279,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Big's secret sex girl? The next morning, Miranda discovered a shocking sex secret of her own.",
280,1.0,6.0,Carrie,She had just spent a wonderful night with Ted who had to leave early in the morning to catch a flight to D.,
281,1.0,6.0,Carrie,C.,
282,1.0,6.0,Carrie,for a conference.,
283,1.0,6.0,Miranda,- I can go home.,
284,1.0,6.0,Ted,It's no big deal.,
285,1.0,6.0,Ted,- No.,
286,1.0,6.0,Ted,Stay.,
287,1.0,6.0,Ted,It's 6:00 A.,
288,1.0,6.0,Ted,M.,
289,1.0,6.0,Ted,I'll be back tonight.,
290,1.0,6.0,Ted,You want to do something? - ,
291,1.0,6.0,Miranda,I'd love to.,
292,1.0,6.0,Ted ,- I'll call you at work.,
293,1.0,6.0,Miranda,Have a good flight.,
294,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Miranda waited for the dead bolt to drop and then used the opportunity to ransack Ted's apartment and look for pictures of old girlfriends.,
295,1.0,6.0,Carrie,She was not at all prepared for what she found.,
296,1.0,6.0,Porn Star,Yeah.,
297,1.0,6.0,Porn Star,"Do you feel your cock where it wants to be every night? Every single night when you come home and everything's done in the house, and I've been doing it all day-- I don't know what to do.",
298,1.0,6.0,Miranda,I can't admit to having found this but now I don't know if I want to see him again.,
299,1.0,6.0,Carrie,How can you judge him till you spank him? - I'm only kidding.,
300,1.0,6.0,Carrie,- But obviously this is what he's into.,
301,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Maybe it's just his fantasy life.,
302,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Later that day, the cream of New York gathered to toast the maiden voyage of my bus.",
303,1.0,6.0,Samantha,- Where's Mr.,
304,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Big? - He couldn't make it.,
305,1.0,6.0,Samantha,"- What do you mean, he couldn't make it? - I don't know.",
306,1.0,6.0,Carrie,It was a work thing.,
307,1.0,6.0,Samantha,But this is your bus party.,
308,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,"I told you you shouldn't have-- Well, never mind.",
309,1.0,6.0,Carrie,What? He's not here because I slept with him on the first date? Yes.,
310,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,When you sleep with a man on the first date the relationship will never be anything more than just sex.,
311,1.0,6.0,Samantha,- Cheers.,
312,1.0,6.0,Carrie,- I didn't want to admit she was right.,
313,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Here it comes! I just wanted to see my bus and get the hell out of there.,
314,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Oh, shit.",
315,1.0,6.0,Mike,Carrie! Did I miss it? Not yet.,
316,1.0,6.0,Carrie,No.,
317,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I thought you were going to bring Libby.,
318,1.0,6.0,Mike,Yeah.,
319,1.0,6.0,Mike,I finally ask her to join me in public; she turns me down.,
320,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Why? ,
321,1.0,6.0,Mike,She told me she met somebody else who doesn't have my problems with intimacy.,
322,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I'm sorry.,
323,1.0,6.0,Samantha,Quiet.,
324,1.0,6.0,Samantha,Here you come.,
325,1.0,6.0,Samantha,"Don't worry, sweetie.",
326,1.0,6.0,Samantha,Don't worry.,
327,1.0,6.0,Samantha,Nobody in New York notices a bus until it's about to him them.,
328,1.0,6.0,Charlotte,That's right.,
329,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Miranda spent another wonderful evening with Ted and began to reevaluate her options.",
330,1.0,6.0,Miranda,That was one of the most amazing meals I have ever had.,
331,1.0,6.0,Miranda,Thank you.,
332,1.0,6.0,Ted,My pleasure.,
333,1.0,6.0,Ted,"You know, I missed you today.",
334,1.0,6.0,Miranda,You did? ,
335,1.0,6.0,Ted,I guess I've just been waiting all this time for a good kick in the head.,
336,1.0,6.0,Miranda,And here I thought that all you really wanted was a good spanking.,
337,1.0,6.0,Ted,- Excuse me? -,
338,1.0,6.0,Miranda ,You heard me.,
339,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Ted didn't take Miranda home that night.,
340,1.0,6.0,Carrie,He never took her calls or returned her messages.,
341,1.0,6.0,Carrie,and she never saw him at the gym again.,
342,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"Very late that night, fueled by a massive quantity of champagne I decided to say good-bye to Mr.",
343,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Big.,
344,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I just came here to tell you that if you're embarrassed or ashamed to be involved with me in any way that we can no longer see each other.,
345,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"The truth is, I blame myself.",
346,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I wore the naked dress on our first date.,
347,1.0,6.0,Carrie,I slept with him too f ast and now I'm on a Fifth Avenue bus with a penis on my head.,
348,1.0,6.0,Big,-What are you talking about? -Y,
349,1.0,6.0,Carrie,ou won't introduce me to your friends.,
350,1.0,6.0,Carrie,You bring me back to that restaurant where men take women they don't want to be seen with.,
351,1.0,6.0,Carrie,You won't come out and meet my friends.,
352,1.0,6.0,Carrie,You have me in a niche.,
353,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Certain events.,
354,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Certain restaurants.,
355,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Certain people.,
356,1.0,6.0,Carrie,Like I'm only a particular fragment of the kind of person you think you should be dating.,
357,1.0,6.0,Big,But I've only gotten to know a particular fragment although I'm beginning to know more.,
358,1.0,6.0,Carrie,No.,
359,1.0,6.0,Carrie,This is not me.,
360,1.0,6.0,Carrie,This is me reacting to your perception of me.,
361,1.0,6.0,Big,Well I think Fung Wa's is the best Chinese food in the city so that's why we went there.,
362,1.0,6.0,Big,"And the guy we met in the street, and I couldn't remember his name-- which possibly means I have Alzheimer's-- so that's what that was about.",
363,1.0,6.0,Big,"And this afternoon I had courtside tickets to the Knicks and that's all, folks.",
364,1.0,6.0,Carrie,"I should have been jumping f r joy, but I only felt a hard knot of fear.",
365,1.0,6.0,Carrie,So you and me-- then maybe this is for real? ,
366,1.0,6.0,Big,Could be.,
0,1.0,7.0,Carrie,The island of Manhattan is a cozy village populated by more than seven million fascinating individuals,
1,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"… who all behave like they own the sidewalk but lately it seemed as if the entire city had been magically reduced to only two people... us. Four-hour conversations flew by in a space of fifteen minutes and a few days apart felt like weeks, I realized that Einstein's law of relativity would have to be amended to include a special set of rules, those to explain the peculiar effects of infatuation.",
2,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Hello?,
3,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"Hi, I'm trying to get hold of a Miss Carrie Bradshaw; she used to be a friend of mine.",
4,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yeah, good morning.",
5,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"Wait, I think I recognize that voice.",
6,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"God, I can't believe it's been that long, I've been meaning to call you. I've just been…",
7,1.0,7.0,Miranda,fucking your brains out?,
8,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Well, yeah, that's the least of it. You know what, I don't think that I have been hit this hard since...nah you know what, I'm not going to compare it to anything else because everything else has always ended.",
9,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"So, will I actually get to see you sometime?",
10,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yeah, absolutely, how about tonight?",
11,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"Yeah, tonight'll work.",
12,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Alright, so I'll call Charlotte and Samantha and see if they're free, ‘cause…Big’s got this dinner thing, so ya’ know, we didn’t have any plans anyway…",
13,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"God, would you listen to yourself?",
14,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yeah, I know, I've become one of those women we hate.",
15,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"Yes you have, I can't talk now, I'll call you later ok?",
16,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"All right, bye.",
17,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"As I hung up, I realized I'd committed the cardinal sin. I'd forsaken my girlfriends for my new boyfriend.",
18,1.0,7.0,Carrie  ,That night I faced the tribunal.,
19,1.0,7.0,Miranda,We really weren't that concerned.,
20,1.0,7.0,Samantha,Just completely hurt and offended.,
21,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Actually, you missed a lot.",
22,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Miranda had worked on a big successful merger… Samantha was obsessed with the idea of a new apartment…And Charlotte, Charlotte was practically engaged. They met the day after I dropped off the edge of the earth… He's name was Michael Conway, he was from a good New York family and he absolutely adored Charlotte.",
23,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,"I think this might be it, I think this might be the one.",
24,1.0,7.0,Samantha,"We’ve met him, he's perfect.",
25,1.0,7.0,Miranda,Even his fucking dog is perfect.,
26,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,But… there's one thing.,
27,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Last night after Michael took Charlotte to the Philharmonic, they went back to his place and began the classic dating ritual …the blowjob tug of war.",
28,1.0,7.0,Michael,"Oh, come on.",
29,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,not tonight.,
30,1.0,7.0,Michael,When?,
31,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Uhm, sometime.",
32,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,The truth is... I hate doing it.,
33,1.0,7.0,Samantha,"Honey, you can't be serious.",
34,1.0,7.0,Miranda,Are telling us you never perform this act?,
35,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"She'll juggle, she'll spin plates, but she won't give head.",
36,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,I don’t like putting it in my mouth. I have a very sensitive gag reflex and it makes me want to puke.,
37,1.0,7.0,Miranda,That's one way to say no.,
38,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,It's not like I haven't tried… practiced on a banana. I pretended it was a popsicle but … I just don’t like it.,
39,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"Personally, I’m loving it up to the point when the guy wants me to swallow.",
40,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Well, that’s just really a judgement call.",
41,1.0,7.0,Samantha,Some men just take it so personally if you don’t.,
42,1.0,7.0,Miranda,Some guys don't give you a choice.,
43,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Well, that’s just bad behavior.",
44,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,Are you honestly telling me you like it?,
45,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Well, it’s not my favorite thing on the menu but, you know, I’ll order it from time to time. And, with the right guy, it can be nice.",
46,1.0,7.0,Miranda,Oral sex is like god's gift to women; you can get off without worrying about getting pregnant.,
47,1.0,7.0,Samantha,"Plus, the sense of power is such a turn on. Maybe you’re on your knees but you’ve got him by the balls.",
48,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Now, you see, that is the reason that I don’t want to go down this road.",
49,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Well, sweetheart if you’re going to get all choked up about it…just don’t do it.",
50,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"But if you don't go down on him, how can you expect him to go down on you?",
51,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,I don’t.,
52,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"Oh well forget it, I only give head to get head.",
53,1.0,7.0,Samantha,Me too.,
54,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"A few hours and a couple of bottles later, vows of friendship renewed, we were almost out the door when…",
55,1.0,7.0,Samantha,Isn’t that Big?,
56,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yeah, I’m going to go over and say hi.",
57,1.0,7.0,Miranda,Ditching us now would be in really bad form.,
58,1.0,7.0,Carrie,I’m not going to ditch you.,
59,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Surprise.,
60,1.0,7.0,Big,"Hey, Carrie, how are you?",
61,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Good, good I was just out here, with my posse having dinner and …er…I saw you.",
62,1.0,7.0,Big,"Oh, uhm, Carrie this is Julia Woods.",
63,1.0,7.0,Big,"Julia, Carrie Bradshaw.",
64,1.0,7.0,Julia,Pleased to meet you.,
65,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Can I talk to you for a second?,
66,1.0,7.0,Big,Sure.,
67,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Excuse me.,
68,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Are you on a date?,
69,1.0,7.0,Big,Sort of.,
70,1.0,7.0,Carrie,I thought you said you had a business thing tonight.,
71,1.0,7.0,Big,I said a dinner thing.,
72,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Well, she’s stunning and I should know because frankly, she stunned me.",
73,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Well, uhm, enjoy your dinner.",
74,1.0,7.0,Big,Are you ok?,
75,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Oh, sure, sure. I was just…er…You know I didn't realize you were dating other women.",
76,1.0,7.0,Big,"Well, not a lot of them. Why don’t we talk about this Saturday?",
77,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Sure, sure, sure. So uhm then, enjoy your dinner. Oh already said that…enjoy it twice.",
78,1.0,7.0,Samantha,Here we go.,
79,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"I can't believe it, he's seeing other women!",
80,1.0,7.0,Samantha,Prick!,
81,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"True, we had never discussed exclusivity. But while for me the idea of seeing another man would be like trying to fit another outfit into an already over-stuffed suitcase, Big was happily dating another woman like it was the most natural thing in the world. Is it that men have an innate aversion to monogamy, or is it more than that? I wondered in a city like New York, with it’s infinite possibilities, has monogamy become too much to expect?",
82,1.0,7.0,Water boy,"I’ve been involved in a monogamous relationship for over a year now. It’s been wonderfully fulfilling. Of course, my definition of monogamy includes sex with prostitutes.",
83,1.0,7.0,Mid 30’s Lady,The problem with monogamy?… it’s just so incredibly dull!,
84,1.0,7.0,Mid-30’s guy,My lover and I have a kind of 90’s monogamy. We have sex with other people but we don’t exchange fluids or phone numbers.,
85,1.0,7.0,Mid 20’s Lady,Monogamy is fabulous it gives you a deep and profound connection to another human being and you don’t have to shave your legs as much.,
86,1.0,7.0,Businessman,"Of course, I’m monogamous. Why, what have you heard?",
87,1.0,7.0,Pamela,This is the c-line. This is the best in the building. Have you ever seen any place like this? Is this to die?,
88,1.0,7.0,Samantha,It’s nice.,
89,1.0,7.0,Pamela,"Hold this, just a second. Excuse me, excuse me, was someone looking for a view?",
90,1.0,7.0,Samantha,"Oh, Pamela it’s beautiful but it’s a little out of my price range.",
91,1.0,7.0,Pamela,"I know, I know, so sue me. I just love to show the crème de la crème. I will break my ass for you, sweetheart. I just want to ask you for one small favor in return.",
92,1.0,7.0,Samantha,My first-born?,
93,1.0,7.0,Pamela,"No, sweetheart. I don’t even want my own kids! Promise me that you won’t work with any other broker.",
94,1.0,7.0,Samantha,Of course.,
95,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Samantha didn’t believe in monogamy, especially when it came to Real Estate agents.",
96,1.0,7.0,Rick,"This is a pre-war six. Notice the classic lines, very solidly built.",
97,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Although Pamela had the hottest contacts in town, Rick did have a slight competitive edge. He gave Samantha the opportunity to combine her two greatest loves… Sex and Real Estate.",
98,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"That afternoon I dragged my poor, tortured soul out to lunch with Stanford Blach and attempted to stun it senseless with cosmopolitans.",
99,1.0,7.0,Stanford,Monogamy is on the way out again. It had a brief comeback in the 90’s but as the millennium approaches everyone’s leaving their options open.,
100,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Come on, you wouldn’t commit to a nice guy given the option?",
101,1.0,7.0,Stanford,I can’t even commit to a long distance Carrier.,
102,1.0,7.0,Carrie,You know what you are? You’re a whore.,
103,1.0,7.0,Stanford,I wish that were true.,
104,1.0,7.0,Jared,"Hey, Stanford.",
105,1.0,7.0,Stanford,"Jared, how are you?",
106,1.0,7.0,Jared,My book just got a kick-ass review at Entertainment Weekly.,
107,1.0,7.0,Stanford,How marvellous!,
108,1.0,7.0,Stanford,"Oh, Jared, have you met Carrie Bradshaw?",
109,1.0,7.0,Jared,"No, but I’ve read your column. Nice shit.",
110,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Thanks.,
111,1.0,7.0,Jared,You should write about me sometime. My life’s so fucked up right now.,
112,1.0,7.0,Stanford,"Oh Carrie, Jared is the writer of the book ¨Avenue B¨. And New York magazine just named him one of the 30 coolest people under 30 in the city.",
113,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Wow, what an honor.",
114,1.0,7.0,Jared,"You know, if they were doing the 30 sexiest women under thirty, I’m sure you’d go right to the top of the list.",
115,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"You’re quite the storyteller, aren’t you?",
116,1.0,7.0,Jared,That’s no lie.,
117,1.0,7.0,Jared,"Listen, the magazine’s having a party tomorrow night at the ¨Bruno¨ I’ll be sure to put your names at the door so, you’ll be there?",
118,1.0,7.0,Carrie,I’ll do my best.,
119,1.0,7.0,Jared,Groovy. Ciao.,
120,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"What was happening to me? I used to get a secret rush from men who hit on me during their fifteen minutes of fame, in this case it nearly felt exhausting.",
121,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Hello.,
122,1.0,7.0,Big,Hello. Hello,
123,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Oh, hi.",
124,1.0,7.0,Big,I was just calling to confirm tomorrow night. Are we still on?,
125,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yeah, of course we are. Why wouldn’t we be?",
126,1.0,7.0,Carrie,I was striving for not coming over but I was worried I had just bordered on shrill.,
127,1.0,7.0,Big,I’ll pick you up at eight.,
128,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"uhm, yeah, it’s fine.",
129,1.0,7.0,Big,I miss you baby.,
130,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yeah, me too.",
131,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"There were so many questions I wanted him to answer but would not ask. Not tonight at least, no, tonight I would ask Miranda.",
132,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"He said, I miss you baby. Do you think that was meant to be some kind of coated ¨mea culpa¨?",
133,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"You mean like, what he really meant was I’ve been a complete idiot please forgive me for having dinner with that other woman.",
134,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yeah, exactly.",
135,1.0,7.0,Miranda,Could be.,
136,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Oh no, ‘cause that would mean that everything he ever said that I interpreted as sincere, was said to interpretation. In that case what I perceive as his feelings for me may only really be reflected rejections of my feelings for him.",
137,1.0,7.0,Miranda,What?,
138,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Oh god, I’m freaking. I gotta stop.",
139,1.0,7.0,Skipper,"Hey, Carrie.",
140,1.0,7.0,Skipper,"Hey guys, great to see you. What are you up to?",
141,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Just, hanging.",
142,1.0,7.0,Skipper,"Oh hey, Allison this is Miranda and Carrie. Miranda, Carrie this is Allison.",
143,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Hello.,
144,1.0,7.0,Allison,"Hi, it’s nice to meet you, I’ve heard so much about you. You know, we’re all such great big fans of your column over at Vogue.",
145,1.0,7.0,Miranda,You work at Vogue?,
146,1.0,7.0,Allison,"Yeah, designer relations. Skipper and I just had the most incredible meal. This darling French Bistro. That I am telling you I lived a year in Paris and never ate so well and cheap. Go quick before the times destroys it with the rain.",
147,1.0,7.0,Skipper,"Anyway, it’s great to see you guys.",
148,1.0,7.0,Allison,"Yeah, great meeting you.",
149,1.0,7.0,Miranda,Who was that self-important bitch?,
150,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"I think that was Skipper’s new girlfriend. Well, she seems alright.",
151,1.0,7.0,Miranda,I didn’t think that was his type.,
152,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Well, that’s true Miranda you’re his type but you broke up with him, remember?",
153,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"Something looks different, has he been working out?",

161,1.0,7.0,Allison,Is everything ok?,
162,1.0,7.0,Skipper,Allison I think you’re great and Uhm…but I gotta be totally honest with you. The woman who I think I love just called and asked me back.,
163,1.0,7.0,Allison,You’re breaking up with me while you’re still inside of me?,

168,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Well, in that case….absolutely.",
169,1.0,7.0,Carrie,And while Charlotte embraced fidelity and Samantha flaunted her infidelity. I found myself caught somewhere in between.,

210,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"For a few minutes, anyway.",
211,1.0,7.0,Skipper,I missed you. I want you to know that that other woman doesn’t mean a thing to me.,

219,1.0,7.0,Skipper,What?,
220,1.0,7.0,Miranda,"I mean…we could see each other and still see other people, right?",

231,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,I hate doing it.,
232,1.0,7.0,Michael,You hate giving blowjobs?,
233,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,It’s not that big of a deal is it?,
234,1.0,7.0,Michael,Sort of. Can’t you just … do it for me?,
235,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,Would you really want me to do something that I didn’t want to do?,

238,1.0,7.0,Michael,"Well, I plan on getting a lot of blow-jobs in the future and I’m hoping that you’re around when I get them.",
239,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,What’s that supposed to mean?,
240,1.0,7.0,Michael,It means I’ll have to find them somewhere else.,
241,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,"You’re telling me that you would give up a woman who really cares for you, who would share your hopes and your fears and your dreams, the future possible mother of your children, all for a blowjob?",
242,1.0,7.0,Michael,"You’re right. Will you at least, lick my balls?",
243,1.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Good bye, Michael.",
244,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"Michael was upset but butterscotch seemed pleased, she was finally back in her monogamous relationship. Half past midnight in a city that never sleeps, neither did the Real Estate market.",
245,1.0,7.0,Samantha,It’s beautiful,
246,1.0,7.0,Rick,"Isn’t it? It went off the market at mid-night and you’re the first one to see it. Two bedrooms, pre-war, fireplace and a view. Everything you wanted.",
247,1.0,7.0,Samantha,"I love it, I really love it.",
248,1.0,7.0,Rick,I knew you would.,
249,1.0,7.0,Samantha,Let’s celebrate.,

251,1.0,7.0,Samantha,I can’t believe you weren’t gonna show me this apartment.,
252,1.0,7.0,Carrie,2 am and I already have a new man in my life.,
253,1.0,7.0,Jared,"You know the greatest thing about writing a successful book, besides the validation the acclaim? knowing that I’m pumping my ideas to the world.",x
254,1.0,7.0,Carrie,I thought it was the fact that you could behave like an utter asshole and people would find you amusing.,
255,1.0,7.0,Jared,"I’m like in love with you, you know that? I’m like fucking in love with you. Will you go out with me tonight?",
256,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Give me a minute; I just have to make a call.,
257,1.0,7.0,Mr.Big,Hello.,
258,1.0,7.0,Carrie,I just had to let you know that I’m at this very cool party for very cool people under thirty and this very cool novelist wants to take me home.,
259,1.0,7.0,Mr.Big,What the hell happened to you?,
260,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"His name is Jared, he’s really cute and really successful and he just put his arms around me. Here, say hello, Jared.",
261,1.0,7.0,Jared,"Hello, Jared.",
262,1.0,7.0,Carrie,That was Jared.,
263,1.0,7.0,Big,"Carrie, just…get over here.",
264,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"No, you get over here.",
265,1.0,7.0,Big,I can’t. I don’t know where you are.,
266,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"I’m at the Lennard Park Café, meet me up front. Your name is not on the list.",
267,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Forty-five minutes later I realized I was alone in a park at 03,
268,1.0,7.0,Mr.Big,What are you doing back here? you said to meet out front.,
269,1.0,7.0,Carrie,This is the front.,
270,1.0,7.0,Mr.Big,"This isn’t the front, this is the back, I’ve been waiting out front for thirty goddammn minutes.",
271,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"You see those doors? That’s the front, you were waiting at the street entrance.",
272,1.0,7.0,Big,The street entrance is the front entrance.,
273,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Depending on where you’re coming from.,
274,1.0,7.0,Big,"Ok, I’m here now, what’s going on?",
275,1.0,7.0,Carrie,"I’ve done the merry-go-round, I’ve been through the revolving door, I feel like I met somebody I can stand still with for a minute and … Don’t you want to stand still with me?",
276,1.0,7.0,Big,You drag me out to a park at 03,
277,1.0,7.0,Carrie,Yes.,
278,1.0,7.0,Carrie,In a city of infinite options sometimes there’s no better feeling than knowing you already have one.,
0,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Once upon a time in a magical land called Manhattan a young woman fell in love.,
1,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Charlotte and Jack locked eyes at a black-tie benefit for Epstein-Barr.,
2,1.0,8.0,Carrie,She chased him through every disease in New York.,
3,1.0,8.0,Carrie,They've been officially dating since retinitis pigmentosis.,
4,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Jack was perfect for her.,
5,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Architect, philanthropist and the sex was amazing.",x
6,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Late one night, Jack popped the inevitable question.",
7,1.0,8.0,Jack,So what are your fantasies?,
8,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,"God, I'd love to own my own gallery and maybe a little cottage in Maine.",
9,1.0,8.0,Jack,"Actually, I meant more like screwing in an airplane bathroom kind of fantasies.",
10,1.0,8.0,Carrie,The closest Charlotte had ever come to getting screwed on a plane was the time she lost all her luggage on a flight to Palm Beach.,
11,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Well I've always wanted to do it in my parents' bed.,
12,1.0,8.0,Jack,Wild. I like it.,
13,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,What about you?,
14,1.0,8.0,Jack,"You, me and another woman.",
15,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Come on! I'm serious.,
16,1.0,8.0,Jack,"Charlotte, you have no idea how sexy you are, do you? The idea of you touching another woman God, it makes me hard just thinking about it.",
17,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Wow.,
18,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Jack wants us to do a threesome.,
19,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Of course he does. Every guy does.,
20,1.0,8.0,Samantha,Threesomes are huge right now.,
21,1.0,8.0,Samantha,They're the blow job of the '90s.,
22,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- What was the blow job of the '80s?,
23,1.0,8.0,Samantha,- Anal sex.,
24,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"- Any sex, period.",
25,1.0,8.0,Miranda,- Don't let him pressure you into it.,
26,1.0,8.0,Miranda,It's just this guy's cheap ploy to watch you be a lesbian for a night.,
27,1.0,8.0,Samantha,- Don't knock it till you've tried it.,
28,1.0,8.0,Miranda,"- I had a threesome once, I think.",
29,1.0,8.0,Miranda,In college.,
30,1.0,8.0,Miranda,I was drunk.,
31,1.0,8.0,Miranda,I woke up in someone else's bra.,
32,1.0,8.0,Samantha,The only way to do a threesome is to be the guest star.,
33,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- The guest star?,
34,1.0,8.0,Samantha,- Yeah.,
35,1.0,8.0,Samantha,"The girl the couple gets to come in, screw and leave.",
36,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- The pinch hitter.,
37,1.0,8.0,Samantha,- Exactly.,
38,1.0,8.0,Samantha,Perfect.,
39,1.0,8.0,Samantha,Great sex without wondering what it will do to your relationship.,
40,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- But you don't have relationships.,
41,1.0,8.0,Samantha,- Which is why I have great sex.,
42,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- I've never done a threesome.,
43,1.0,8.0,Miranda,- Because you have relationships.,
44,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,I've never done a threesome.,
45,1.0,8.0,Samantha,Of course you haven't.,
46,1.0,8.0,Samantha,You in a threesome? You won't even wear a thong.,
47,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- Jack thinks I'm sexy.,
48,1.0,8.0,Miranda,- He's buttering you up.,
49,1.0,8.0,Miranda,"You start thinking you're hot, then he brings up the threesome thing.",
50,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Boom! Suddenly you're kissing another woman while he beats off.,
51,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Please! ,
52,1.0,8.0,Samantha,"Just make sure the other woman isn't a friend. Use somebody random, somebody you meet in a bar or something.",
53,1.0,8.0,Miranda,- That's romantic.,
54,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- No.,
55,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,"I think I'd feel safer with a friend, with someone I could trust.",
56,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Like Carrie.,
57,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Gee, I'm flattered.",
58,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"But I'd go with someone who has a little more experience, like Sam.",
59,1.0,8.0,Samantha,"Well, thanks.",
60,1.0,8.0,Samantha,But there is something sexy about a first-timer like Charlotte.,
61,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- Really?,
62,1.0,8.0,Samantha,- Yeah.,
63,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Great.,
64,1.0,8.0,Miranda,"No, forget about me.",
65,1.0,8.0,Samantha,- Come on.,
66,1.0,8.0,Miranda,- I'd do it with you guys.,
67,1.0,8.0,Miranda,It's like picking teams for dodgeball all over again.,
68,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Was Samantha right? Were threesomes the new sexual frontier? No question.,
69,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Guys were infatuated with threesomes.,
70,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"And when I started looking, they were everywhere.",
71,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"After all, our lives are built on threesomes.",
72,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Fat, low-fat, nonfat.",
73,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"First, business, economy.",
74,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Moe, Larry, Curly.",
75,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Maybe we were never meant to do it with only one other person.,
76,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Maybe threesomes were the relationship of the future.,
77,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Samantha had been busy guest-starring in a show I like to call ""Sam Does the Married Guy.",
78,1.0,8.0,Ken,""" I love that you're not my wife.",
79,1.0,8.0,Samantha,"I love that, too.",
80,1.0,8.0,Ken,"I mean, that thing you do with your hips! Ruth won't even get on top.",
81,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Ken was 37, a wine importer unhappily married to a woman who designed modular office furniture.",x
82,1.0,8.0,Carrie,This affair was the most exciting thing that had happened to him since the '94 Montrachet.,
83,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Five hours later, Charlotte's night was just beginning.",
84,1.0,8.0,Carrie,She and Jack had just had another fantastic date dancing for dyslexia.,
85,1.0,8.0,Jack,"So, what do you think of her? - Is she hot? You're right.",
86,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- Jack!,
87,1.0,8.0,Jack,You're right. Maybe she's more your taste.,
88,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- Stop it.,
89,1.0,8.0,Woman,- Have a light? ,
90,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Sorry, I don't smoke.",
91,1.0,8.0,Woman,That's a shame.,
92,1.0,8.0,Jack,Did you see that? She was flirting with us.,
93,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,I think she was flirting with you.,
94,1.0,8.0,Jack,"You are such a turn on, and you have no idea.",
95,1.0,8.0,Jack,You're giving off this sexual energy all the time.,
96,1.0,8.0,Jack,A vibe like you've got a fire inside of you.,
97,1.0,8.0,Jack,She'd be crazy not to be in to you.,
98,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Who knows whether it was her vodka or her vibe but Charlotte suddenly did feel a little warm.,
99,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,I think she put her hand on my leg.,
100,1.0,8.0,Jack,Should I ask her to join us? ,
101,1.0,8.0,Carrie,That night she had an eye-opening experience.,
102,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Charlotte hadn't been that excited since she tried on her cheerleading uniform.,
103,1.0,8.0,Therapist,"What do you think your dream meant? I'm in the sand box with Charlotte, Sam and Carrie and they won't play with me.",
104,1.0,8.0,Miranda,"I'm in the sand box with Charlotte, Sam and Carrie and they won't play with me.",
105,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Please.,
106,1.0,8.0,Miranda,It's obvious.,
107,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Across town, Miranda was dealing with her own nightmare.",
108,1.0,8.0,Miranda,"I know it's juvenile, but it bothers me.",
109,1.0,8.0,Miranda,"I'm attractive, smart.",
110,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Right? Plenty of people should want me for a threesome.,
111,1.0,8.0,Therapist,So you're saying you're attracted to your girlfriends.,
112,1.0,8.0,Miranda,"No! But if your friends won't go down on you, who will? That's some dream.",
113,1.0,8.0,Carrie,That's some dream.,
114,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,It was so real.,
115,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,I can't stop thinking about it.,
116,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- And I think I enjoyed it.,
117,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- That's great.,
118,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Dreams are a good way to experiment.,
119,1.0,8.0,Carrie,It's like buying a dress and keeping the tags on.,
120,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Do you think it means I should do it? Have a threesome? Jack says that I have a fire inside me.,
121,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Tell him they make a cream for that.,
122,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,I'm serious.,
123,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"It's your call, but don't do it just to make Jack happy.",
124,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Maybe it would bring us closer.,
125,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Isn't it weird that you're thinking of sleeping with someone you don't know to get closer to Jack?,
126,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,How well do we ever know the people we sleep with?,
127,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"That was the thing about Charlotte. Just as you were about to write her off as a Park Avenue Pollyanna she'd say something so right on, you'd think she was the Dalai Lama.",
128,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Do you think my hair too shiny today?,
129,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"And then, she'd say something else.",
130,1.0,8.0,Carrie,But the bigger question remained.,
131,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"If Charlotte was actually considering a threesome, who wasn't? The Village Voice had more ads looking for threesomes than it did for small, rat-infested studios running at $1000 a month.",
132,1.0,8.0,Carrie,But who actually answered these ads?,
133,1.0,8.0,Honcho,Wall Street honcho seeks two horny gal pals for an East Hampton fuck-fest at my summer home.,

143,1.0,8.0,Carrie,I seem to be the only person in New York who still believed in the one-on-one relationship.,
144,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Big and I were actually doing sleep-overs.,
145,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Which one?,
146,1.0,8.0,Big,This one.,
147,1.0,8.0,Big,You better be careful.,
148,1.0,8.0,Big,I could get used to this.,
149,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Why is it that putting a tie around a man's neck is sometimes even sexier than taking it off?,
150,1.0,8.0,Big,What are you doing for lunch today? I could maybe swing an hour between meetings.,
151,1.0,8.0,Carrie,No.,
152,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Sorry, I can't.",
153,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- I have to interview someone.,
154,1.0,8.0,Big,- About what?,
155,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Threesomes.,
156,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Ever done one?,
157,1.0,8.0,Big,Sure.,
158,1.0,8.0,Big,Who hasn't? ,
159,1.0,8.0,Carrie,With who?,
160,1.0,8.0,Carrie,My ex-wife.,
161,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Suddenly my column was the last thing on my mind.,
162,1.0,8.0,Carrie,You were married?,
163,1.0,8.0,Big,Yeah. I thought I told you.,
164,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"No, you didn't.",
165,1.0,8.0,Miranda,An ex-wife.,
166,1.0,8.0,Miranda,That's a new twist.,
167,1.0,8.0,Carrie,And they had wild sex.,
168,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Threesomes.,
169,1.0,8.0,Carrie,We don't have wild sex.,
170,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"We used to, but now we have sweet sex.",
171,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Wild always beats out sweet.,
172,1.0,8.0,Miranda,- But he's not with her anymore.,
173,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- Because they stopped having wild sex.,
174,1.0,8.0,Samantha,That's why Ken's fucking me.,
175,1.0,8.0,Samantha,- His wife won't give him a blow job.,
176,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- Should that make me feel better?,
177,1.0,8.0,Miranda,He's never going to leave his wife for you. They never do.,
178,1.0,8.0,Samantha,Thank God.,
179,1.0,8.0,Samantha,Who needs the trouble? This is ideal.,
180,1.0,8.0,Samantha,"No muss, no fuss.",
181,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Sounds like you're selling toilet bowl cleaner.,
182,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Does this color turn you on?,
183,1.0,8.0,Carrie,You had to hand it to Miranda. She was determined.,
184,1.0,8.0,Carrie,It's a little orange.,
185,1.0,8.0,Samantha,There's only one thing left to do.,
186,1.0,8.0,Carrie,What? Leave him before he leaves me?,
187,1.0,8.0,Miranda,You kidding? Check out the ex.,
188,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Charlotte was right.,
189,1.0,8.0,Carrie,We don't really know the people we sleep with.,
190,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"After all, what did I really know about Mr.",
191,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Big? Except he had an ex-wife named Barbara, who, I discovered, worked in publishing.",
192,1.0,8.0,Carrie,My plan was simple.,
193,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"I'd pitch her a steamy, bodice-ripping paperback which she'd probably reject but at least I'd get five minutes face-to-face with her.",
194,1.0,8.0,Receptionist,Carrie? Come right in.,
195,1.0,8.0,Receptionist,Barbara's ready for you.,
196,1.0,8.0,Barabara,Thanks.,

201,1.0,8.0,Barabara,I'm a huge fan of your work.,
202,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Good taste and beautiful.,
203,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Could it get worse? Oh.,
204,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Special Olympics chairwoman.,
205,1.0,8.0,Barabara,Sorry.,
206,1.0,8.0,Barabara,I haven't hung it yet.,
207,1.0,8.0,Barabara,"So, I'm dying to hear your pitch.",
208,1.0,8.0,Barabara,I never knew you were interested in writing children's books.,
209,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Well, who doesn't love children's books? Five minutes of bodice-ripping material out the window.",
210,1.0,8.0,Carrie,So I did what any writer would do.,
211,1.0,8.0,Carrie,I pulled an idea out of my ass.,
212,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Well, my story is about a little girl named Cathy, Little Cathy.",
213,1.0,8.0,Barabara,What makes Little Cathy special?,
214,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Well, she's got these magic cigarettes.",
215,1.0,8.0,Barabara,- She has magic cigarettes?,
216,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- Yes.,
217,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Little Cathy and her magic cigarettes.,
218,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Whenever she lights up, she can go anywhere in the whole wide world.",
219,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Arabia, New Jersey.",
220,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"I mean, that stuff is gonna be all worked out, of course.",
221,1.0,8.0,Barabara,You want to write a children's book about smoking?,
222,1.0,8.0,Carrie,It's a children's book for adults.,
223,1.0,8.0,Barabara,You are outrageous.,
224,1.0,8.0,Barabara,I love it.,
225,1.0,8.0,Carrie,I thought you might.,
226,1.0,8.0,Barabara,I have been dying to do something with an edge.,
227,1.0,8.0,Barabara,This could be great.,
228,1.0,8.0,Carrie,It was the last straw.,
229,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"She was smart, beautiful, and she got me.",
230,1.0,8.0,Carrie,I'd have to kill her.,
231,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Samantha was about to have her own encounter with the third kind.",
232,1.0,8.0,Samantha,"Oh, I'm sorry.",
233,1.0,8.0,Samantha,- Ken!,
234,1.0,8.0,Ken,Sam!,
235,1.0,8.0,Ruth,- You two know each other?,
236,1.0,8.0,Samantha,Sure.,
237,1.0,8.0,Ken,Not really.,
238,1.0,8.0,Ken,"Ruth, this is Sam.",
239,1.0,8.0,Ken,Samantha.,
240,1.0,8.0,Ken,She bought pinot noir from me.,
241,1.0,8.0,Ken,"- Sam, this is my wife Ruth.",
242,1.0,8.0,Ruth,- Hi.,
243,1.0,8.0,Ken,"Okay, we should be going.",
244,1.0,8.0,Ken,See you.,
245,1.0,8.0,Carrie,That afternoon was a first for Samantha.,
246,1.0,8.0,Carrie,She successfully screwed a guy in under two minutes.,
247,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"The more Miranda analyzed, the worse her nightmares got.",
248,1.0,8.0,Miranda,"So, the four of us get into a cab, only they won't let me sit in back with them.",
249,1.0,8.0,Miranda,"They make me ride in front with the driver, who's the original Chris from The Partridge Family.",
250,1.0,8.0,Therapist,What I'm hearing is you're still very upset about being sexually rejected by your friends.,
251,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Let me ask you something.,
252,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Would you do a threesome with me?,
253,1.0,8.0,Therapist,I think we need to talk about why you're asking me that.,
254,1.0,8.0,Carrie,I take that as a no.,
255,1.0,8.0,Carrie,That night I thought I could put the whole Barbara thing out of my mind.,
256,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"After all, Mr.",
257,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Big was with me now.,
258,1.0,8.0,Barbara,Nibbling his ear lobes? How sweet.,
259,1.0,8.0,Barbara,Let me show you how it's really done.,
260,1.0,8.0,Carrie,So I guess you couldn't avoid a threesome because even if you're the only person in the bed someone has always been there before you.,
261,1.0,8.0,Big,What just happened? Where'd you go?,
262,1.0,8.0,Carrie,I was preoccupied.,
263,1.0,8.0,Big,No kidding.,
264,1.0,8.0,Big,About what?,
265,1.0,8.0,Carrie," Your ex-wife's breasts, your ex-wife's lips your ex-wife's long legs. My column.",
266,1.0,8.0,Big,"You know, I didn't tell you I was married because it was a long time ago.",
267,1.0,8.0,Carrie,What happened?,
268,1.0,8.0,Big,Alienation of affection followed by divorce. Let's not talk about the past. Please? ,
269,1.0,8.0,Carrie,What Mr.,
270,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Big didn't realize was the past was sleeping right next to me.,
271,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"The next day, the flesh-and-blood Barbara asked me to lunch.",
272,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Hi.,
273,1.0,8.0,Barbara,Thanks for meeting me.,
274,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Thanks for inviting me.,
275,1.0,8.0,Barbara,Wow! You changed your hair.,

279,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- I'm back with Mr.,
280,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Big?,
281,1.0,8.0,Barbara,The head guys didn't go for Little Cathy. But fuck 'em.,
282,1.0,8.0,Barbara,They wouldn't know a good book if it bit them in the ass.,
283,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Yeah, fuck 'em.",
284,1.0,8.0,Barbara,I still love the project.,
285,1.0,8.0,Barbara,And at the risk of sounding like a groupie I'd really like it if we could become friends.,
286,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Friends? Two hours and four chardonnays later, I was sleeping with the enemy.",
287,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"- So, never been married?",
288,1.0,8.0,Barbara,- Once. Long time ago.,
289,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Really? What happened?,
290,1.0,8.0,Barbara, He had a wandering eye. Wandered right over to my best friend. What about you? Are you seeing anyone? ,
291,1.0,8.0,Carrie,No one special.,
292,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"For Samantha, the shit was about to hit the phone.",
293,1.0,8.0,Samantha,Hello.,

308,1.0,8.0,Samantha,You love your wife.,
309,1.0,8.0,Ken,- No.,
310,1.0,8.0,Ken,I'm in love with you.,
311,1.0,8.0,Samantha,"- No, no, no.",
312,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Sam's ""no muss, no fuss"" affair was starting to feel very mussy.",
313,1.0,8.0,Samantha,- I'm back.,
314,1.0,8.0,Ruth,- I don't know who you are but Ken and I love each other very much.,
315,1.0,8.0,Samantha,Of course you do.,
316,1.0,8.0,Ruth,We have an unshakable bond.,
317,1.0,8.0,Ruth,"Whatever it takes, I'll keep this marriage together.",
318,1.0,8.0,Samantha,Good for you.,
319,1.0,8.0,Samantha,"Listen, this was a huge mistake.",
320,1.0,8.0,Samantha,It didn't mean anything.,
321,1.0,8.0,Samantha,It was just sex.,
322,1.0,8.0,Ruth,"Exactly! And if being sexually adventuresome will keep this marriage together, then I am prepared to join you with him in bed.",
323,1.0,8.0,Samantha,"Oh, no.",
324,1.0,8.0,Samantha,"No, no, no.",
325,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Samantha was a guest star.,
326,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Series regular was not in her contract.,
327,1.0,8.0,Carrie,That night at the Attention Deficit Disorder Masked Ball Charlotte felt free to indulge her fantasy.,
328,1.0,8.0,Carrie,It's amazing what sequins on a stick can do to free up inhibitions.,
329,1.0,8.0,Jack,Who here is your type?,
330,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Do you like peacocks?,
331,1.0,8.0,Jack,Do you?,
332,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Then Charlotte did the unthinkable.,
333,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Oh, my God.",
334,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,She winked at me.,
335,1.0,8.0,Jack,Excellent.,
336,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,I need to get out of here.,

339,1.0,8.0,Jack,- How'd it feel?,
340,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- Weird.,
341,1.0,8.0,Jack,"Well, I enjoyed it.",
342,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,- I do have another fantasy.,
343,1.0,8.0,Jack,- What's that?,
344,1.0,8.0,Charlotte,Doing it upstairs at a party.,
345,1.0,8.0,Woman 4,Can I join you?,
346,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"She realized that this was her moment. If she was going to take the plunge, it was now or never.",
347,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, it was Jack who plunged first.",
348,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Apparently someone else's fire was a little stronger than Charlotte's.,
349,1.0,8.0,Carrie,She was not the guest star in this fantasy.,
350,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, at a bar downtown.",
351,1.0,8.0,Man,- Miranda?,
352,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Hi.,
353,1.0,8.0,Woman 5,What a relief.,

357,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Thanks.,
358,1.0,8.0,Man,We've never done anything like this before.,
359,1.0,8.0,Woman 5,It's a huge fantasy of Mark's.,
360,1.0,8.0,Woman 5,I offered to do it for this 30th birthday.,
361,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Whatever happened to giving a nice pen?,
362,1.0,8.0,Man,Are you doing anything tonight?,
363,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Let me just be clear here.,
364,1.0,8.0,Miranda,You want to do a threesome with me.,
365,1.0,8.0,Man,"If you're busy, we understand.",
366,1.0,8.0,Miranda,I tell you what.,
367,1.0,8.0,Miranda,Let me just make a quick phone call. Okay? ,
368,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"That night, Miranda finally got her validation.",
369,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Her shrink had suggested she come three times a week.,
370,1.0,8.0,Carrie,I didn't see Mr.,
371,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Big for eight days.,
372,1.0,8.0,Big,- That was a great meal.,
373,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"- Yeah, it was.",
374,1.0,8.0,Big,"Actually, the food was terrible, and we were talking to each other like strangers.",
375,1.0,8.0,Big,What is wrong?,
376,1.0,8.0,Carrie," Look, you tell me you have an ex-wife. You tell me you guys had a three-way.",
377,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"Yes, I asked.",
378,1.0,8.0,Carrie,"You drop this big bomb, and you don't give me any details.",
379,1.0,8.0,Big,- You didn't tell me why you broke up.,
380,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- I cheated on her.,
381,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- I know.,
382,1.0,8.0,Carrie,She told me at lunch.,
383,1.0,8.0,Big,- I know you know.,
384,1.0,8.0,Big,She told me she told you.,
385,1.0,8.0,Carrie,- She told you?,
386,1.0,8.0,Big,- She told me.,
387,1.0,8.0,Carrie,That's another thing.,
388,1.0,8.0,Carrie,You didn't tell me that you're still talking to her.,
389,1.0,8.0,Carrie,I still talk to all my ex-wives.,
390,1.0,8.0,Carrie,I'm so not finding that funny.,
391,1.0,8.0,Big,"Oh, come-- Wait a minute.",
392,1.0,8.0,Big,The reason we had the threesome is because we were both looking for something or someone else.,
393,1.0,8.0,Big,Do you know anyone who's right for me?,
394,1.0,8.0,Carrie,Then it was just the two of us. And I realized the real appeal of the threesome: It was easy.,
395,1.0,8.0,Carrie,It's intimacy that's the bitch.,
0,1.0,9.0,Carrie,In a city of perfect people...,
1,1.0,9.0,Carrie,no one was more perfect than Brooke.,
2,1.0,9.0,Carrie,She was an interior designer who only dated A-list guys.,

5,1.0,9.0,Carrie,we were all dying to see which one had made the cut.,
6,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Was I the only one who remembered that Brooke once described this man...,
7,1.0,9.0,Carrie,as more boring than exposed brick?,
8,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"It was your average $100,000 wedding.",
9,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Investment bankers and the women who hate them...,
10,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"classmates from Steiner, Dalton and Brown...",
11,1.0,9.0,Carrie,and us.,
12,1.0,9.0,Carrie,We looked like The Witches of Eastwick.,
13,1.0,9.0,Carrie,A wedding this size always has two singles tables.,
14,1.0,9.0,Carrie,We were at the other one.,
15,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,Hello.,
16,1.0,9.0,Bernie,"Hi. I'm Bernie Turtletaub, friend of the groom.",
17,1.0,9.0,Carrie,It was the Turtle. A Manhattan legend known for two things:,

24,1.0,9.0,Bernie,Your friend is gorgeous.,
25,1.0,9.0,Bernie,What do I have to do to get to know her better?,
26,1.0,9.0,Bernie,Do you think the pears in this tart are bosc or bartlett?,
27,1.0,9.0,Miranda,Who cares?,
28,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Two hours later, we were bored.",
29,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Supplies were dwindling...,
30,1.0,9.0,Carrie,and one of our passengers had jumped ship.,
31,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,Are we gonna stick around and catch the bouquet?,
32,1.0,9.0,Miranda,That is so not going to happen.,
33,1.0,9.0,Bernie,Bosc! They've got to be bosc.,
34,1.0,9.0,Brooke,Can you believe I finally did it?,
35,1.0,9.0,Brooke,You're next. Bill's got some great single friends.,
36,1.0,9.0,Brooke,It's always better to marry someone who loves you more than you love them.,
37,1.0,9.0,Carrie,People are always telling me things I don't want to hear.,
38,1.0,9.0,Carrie,But this one crossed the line.,
39,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Did I wake you?,
40,1.0,9.0,Big,- Not at all. ,
41,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- Question.,
42,1.0,9.0,Big,Why do people get married if they're not in love?,
43,1.0,9.0,Big,I don't know.,
44,1.0,9.0,Big,"Companionship, guilt, political asylum?",
45,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- Why did you get married? ,
46,1.0,9.0,Big,- I was a fool in love.,
47,1.0,9.0,Carrie,That is so sweet.,
48,1.0,9.0,Big,-And then I was a fool in divorce court. ,
49,1.0,9.0,Carrie,-Now you're just a fool.,
50,1.0,9.0,Big,Exactly. Which is why I'm never getting married again.,
51,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Suddenly, I had to concentrate on breathing.",
52,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- Are you in bed with someone?  ,
53,1.0,9.0,Big,- No. Are you?,
54,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Just three slices of wedding cake. You jealous?,

56,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- Good night. ,
57,1.0,9.0,Big,- Good night.,
58,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I hung up the phone wondering...,

61,1.0,9.0,Samantha,Don't tell me you're surprised by this.,
62,1.0,9.0,Miranda,You know who wants to get married? Men who miss their mommies.,
63,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Maybe this wasn't my target audience.,
64,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,Am I the only one who thinks this is a major bummer?,
65,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,What if you spend five years with him and in the end you have nothing to show for it?,
66,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I wasn't thinking about marriage until he told me to think about it. Now it's all I think about.,
67,1.0,9.0,Samantha,Just be cool. You don't care.,
68,1.0,9.0,Samantha,Then he'll wonder why you don't...,
69,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"which will make him realize he does, and then it's a whole new ball game.",
70,1.0,9.0,Miranda,"So in your world, it's always sixth grade.",
71,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,I think that a relationship has to be based on honesty and communication if it has any chance of succeeding.,
72,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"Okay. If you were 25, that would be adorable...",
73,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"but you're 32 now, so that's just stupid.",

75,1.0,9.0,Group,- Yes. No!,
76,1.0,9.0,Miranda,"What's the big deal? ln 50 years, men are gonna be obsolete anyway.",
77,1.0,9.0,Miranda,"I mean. Already you can't talk to them, you don't need them to have kids with...",
78,1.0,9.0,Miranda,you don't even need them to have sex with anymore...,
79,1.0,9.0,Miranda,as I've just very pleasantly discovered.,
80,1.0,9.0,Samantha,Uh-oh. Sounds like somebody just got their first vibrator.,
81,1.0,9.0,Miranda,Not first. Ultimate. And I think I'm in love.,
82,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"Oh, please, stop! This is so sad.",
83,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I'm not gonna replace a man with some battery-operated device.,
84,1.0,9.0,Miranda,"You say that, but you haven't met ""The Rabbit.""",
85,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"If you're gonna get a vibrator, at least get one called ""The Horse.""",
86,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,A vibrator does not call you on your birthday. A vibrator doesn't send you flowers the next day...,
87,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,and you cannot take a vibrator home to meet your mother.,
88,1.0,9.0,Miranda,I know where my next orgasm is coming from. Who here can say as much?,
89,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"That night, Samantha went on a date with a flesh and blood man...",
90,1.0,9.0,Carrie,while the three of us went in search of furrier companionship.,
91,1.0,9.0,Miranda,"Ladies, I'd like you to meet the Rabbit.",
92,1.0,9.0,Carrie,$92?,
93,1.0,9.0,Miranda,Please! Think about the money we spend on shoes.,
94,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,I have no intention of using that. I'm saving sex for someone I love.,
95,1.0,9.0,Miranda,Fantastic. Is there a man in the picture?,
96,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"Look! Oh, it's so cute.",
97,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"I thought it would be all scary and weird, but it isn't. It's pink!",
98,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,For girls!,
99,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,Look. The little bunny has a little face like Peter Rabbit.,
100,1.0,9.0,Carrie,It's even got a remote. How lazy do you have to be?,
101,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Later that night, back at the brier patch--",
102,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Hello?,
103,1.0,9.0,Samantha,You are not going to believe the evening I've had.,
104,1.0,9.0,Samantha,- Are you listening to me? ,
105,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- Yeah.,

108,1.0,9.0,Jerry,"From the moment I saw you at that wedding, I knew we'd have dinner together.",
109,1.0,9.0,Samantha,Aren't you cocky!,
110,1.0,9.0,Jerry,"I'm the kind of guy, I see something...",
111,1.0,9.0,Jerry,"I like it, I go after it.",
112,1.0,9.0,Samantha,You sound like my kind of guy.,
113,1.0,9.0,Jerry,Hold that thought. I'll be right back.,
114,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Ten minutes and a couple of cocktails later--,
115,1.0,9.0,Samantha,Where the hell is he?,
116,1.0,9.0,Carrie,He obviously had seen something else he liked and gone after it.,
117,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Then, just when she thought her evening couldn't get any worse--",
118,1.0,9.0,Bernie,"Samantha? Hey, Samantha!",
119,1.0,9.0,Bernie,It's me.,
120,1.0,9.0,Bernie,Bernie Turtletaub from the wedding.,
121,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"Oh, right.",
122,1.0,9.0,Bernie,Are you here all by yourself?,
123,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"Well, sort of. I'm--",
124,1.0,9.0,Bernie,"Sit down, join me!",
125,1.0,9.0,Bernie,"God, you look great.",
126,1.0,9.0,Carrie,What Samantha needed now more than anything was a compliment from anyone.,
127,1.0,9.0,Bernie,I can't believe the synchronicity. I was just thinking about you!,
128,1.0,9.0,Bernie,"So, do you like this shirt?",
129,1.0,9.0,Bernie,My ex-girlfriend picked it out for me.,
130,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"Honey, no offense, but your breath--",
131,1.0,9.0,Bernie,I know.,
132,1.0,9.0,Bernie,"It's these Chinese herbs I'm taking. You know, for longer life.",
133,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"Well, with breath like that, you're gonna live a very long life alone.",
134,1.0,9.0,Bernie,I killed the last woman who talked to me like that.,
135,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Samantha was impressed. The Turtle had attempted a joke.,
136,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"Once we get the breath under control, I'm gonna take him shopping for a whole new wardrobe.",
137,1.0,9.0,Samantha,He's a cute little fixer-upper.,
138,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Sweetheart, he's a man, not a brownstone.",
139,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"Honey, when I'm through with him, he'll be Gracie Mansion.",
140,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Samantha and the Turtle?,
141,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"But then again, I'm dating a man who will never get married...",
142,1.0,9.0,Carrie,and Miranda is having a meaningful relationship with something that comes in a box from Japan.,
143,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"In a city of great expectations, is it time to settle for what you can get?",
144,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I needed some answers.,
145,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Later that week, I met Brooke.",
146,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Just back from her honeymoon, she was all business: the business of marriage.",
147,1.0,9.0,Brooke,I'd like to return these.,
148,1.0,9.0,Brooke,Is there any way you can melt them down into one decent gift?,
149,1.0,9.0,Brooke,His friends.,
150,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"So, how is it being married?",
151,1.0,9.0,Brooke,It's fabulous. I feel like an enormous weight has been lifted.,
152,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- And that's a good thing. ,
153,1.0,9.0,Brooke, What's that supposed to mean?,
154,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"It just means you're happy with Allen, right?",
155,1.0,9.0,Brooke,"Yes, I'm happy.",
156,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Then I'm happy for you.,
157,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Listen, I hope I didn't give you the wrong idea.",
158,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I think Allen's great.,
159,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"I mean, he's incredibly successful.",
160,1.0,9.0,Brooke,We think we're Carolyn Bessette. One day John ,
161,1.0,9.0,Brooke,-John's out of the picture...,
162,1.0,9.0,Brooke,and we're happy just to have some guy who can throw around a frisbee.,
163,1.0,9.0,Brooke,"- Look who's here. Hey, you two! ",
164,1.0,9.0,Bernie,- What a small world!,
165,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I couldn't believe it.,
166,1.0,9.0,Carrie,It was the Turtle wearing Helmut Lange.,
167,1.0,9.0,Brooke,"- Wow, he looks great! ",
168,1.0,9.0,Samantha,- Doesn't he?,
169,1.0,9.0,Carrie,He twirls!,
170,1.0,9.0,Samantha,- What do you think? ,
171,1.0,9.0,Brooke,- Fabulous.,
172,1.0,9.0,Samantha,He's like a whole new person.,
173,1.0,9.0,Bernie,Don't I have a 3:00?,
174,1.0,9.0,Samantha,That's right. I'm taking him to Bliss for a facial.,
175,1.0,9.0,Samantha,See you later. Bye.,
176,1.0,9.0,Brooke,"I have to run, too. I'll call you.",
177,1.0,9.0,Brooke,Smart girl.,
178,1.0,9.0,Brooke,She seems happy.,
179,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Samantha left with the Turtle, Brooke left with a better gift...",
180,1.0,9.0,Carrie,and I left wondering if everyone in Manhattan was settling.,
181,1.0,9.0,Carrie,My Zen teacher once told me that there was nothing like yoga to quiet a busy mind.,
182,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Just as I had reached the moment of no thought--,
183,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,- I think I broke my vagina. ,
184,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- Sorry. Am I pulling too hard?,
185,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"Metaphorically, I mean. With the Rabbit.",
186,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,- Yes.,
187,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- So you've been using it!  ,
188,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"I'm scared if I keep using it, I won't be able to enjoy sex with a man again.",
189,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Why?,
190,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,Have you ever been with a man..You know...,
191,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,and he's like... he's doing everything and it feels good...,
192,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,but somehow you just can't manage to--,
193,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Come?,
194,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,Yeah.,
195,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"Well, it's weird, 'cause with the Rabbit it's like every time, boom!",
196,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"And one time, I came for like five minutes.",
197,1.0,9.0,Carrie,It's not illegal.,
198,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"Yeah, but no man ever did that. I'm scared. What am I gonna do?",
199,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Well, you know. You could still enjoy sex with a man and the Rabbit.",
200,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"No, no. I'm done with it.",
201,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,That's it. I'm never going to touch that thing again.,
202,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,- I got to cancel on the ballet tonight. ,
203,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- Why?,
204,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,I'm expecting a phone call...,
205,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"Iong distance phone call, transatlantic.",
206,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Charlotte could never tell a decent lie.,
207,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I knew an addict when I saw one.,
208,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"I love Sleeping Beauty! The music, the sex, the costumes!",
209,1.0,9.0,Carrie,It's so romantic!,
210,1.0,9.0,Stanford,"You only like it because she gets to sleep for 100 years, and she doesn't age.",
211,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I invited Stanford to the ballet. I knew he was available.,
212,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Stanford, cute, huh?",
213,1.0,9.0,Stanford,I've had it with the whole gay scene.,
214,1.0,9.0,Stanford,It's so competitive. You won't believe what happened to me last week.,
215,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Evidently Stanford, tired of bars and blind dates...",
216,1.0,9.0,Carrie,decided to place a personal ad.,
217,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"He scheduled a rendezvous with the only respondent on a cold, Sunday afternoon.",
218,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Twenty minutes and three false alarms later, he was ready to call it quits.",
219,1.0,9.0,Man,Stanford?,
220,1.0,9.0,Stanford,Yes.,
221,1.0,9.0,Man,Sorry. This is not gonna happen.,
222,1.0,9.0,Stanford,It's so brutal out there.,
223,1.0,9.0,Stanford,Even guys like me don't want guys like me.,
224,1.0,9.0,Stanford,I just don't have that gay look.,
225,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I don't know. You look pretty gay to me.,
226,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Come on, maybe it's just a phase.",
227,1.0,9.0,Stanford,Puberty is a phase. Fifteen years of rejection is a lifestyle.,
228,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Sometimes I think I should just marry a woman and get all the money.,
229,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"- What is there, a cash prize?  ",
230,1.0,9.0,Stanford,Yeah,
231,1.0,9.0,Stanford,My grandmother gives everyone in the family their inheritance when they get married.,
232,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- She doesn't know you're gay?  ,
233,1.0,9.0,Stanford,- She doesn't believe in gay.,
234,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Really? That's funny. Big doesn't believe in marriage.,
235,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Maybe you should propose to me, and we'll all live happily ever after.",
236,1.0,9.0,Stanford,-You really do want it all. ,
237,1.0,9.0,Carrie,-I don't know. Maybe nobody gets it all.,
238,1.0,9.0,Stanford,"Though, you do have a point.",
239,1.0,9.0,Stanford,We're best friends. We make each other laugh.,
240,1.0,9.0,Stanford,We both sleep with men.,
241,1.0,9.0,Stanford,This is not a bad idea at all.,
242,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"- Actually, I was kidding. ",
243,1.0,9.0,Stanford,- I'm not! Think about it.,
244,1.0,9.0,Stanford,Who else would keep you in expensive shoes and encourage you to cheat?,
245,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Now you're talking!,
246,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Friday night at the ballet with a man who shared my passion for hot men in tights.,
247,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Saturday afternoon in bed with a man who shared my passion for passion.,
248,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Maybe there was such a thing as having it all.,
249,1.0,9.0,Big,What's that smile about?,
250,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Oh, I got a marriage proposal last night.",
251,1.0,9.0,Big,Really?,
252,1.0,9.0,Big,From whom?,
253,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"A very handsome, witty young man about to come into his inheritance.",
254,1.0,9.0,Big,"Oh, I see. Anyone I know?",
255,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Actually his name is Stanford. Stanford Blatch.,
256,1.0,9.0,Big,I thought he was gay.,
257,1.0,9.0,Carrie,He is.,
258,1.0,9.0,Big,That should make for an interesting column.,
259,1.0,9.0,Big,What are you gonna do about sex?,
260,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I have you.,
261,1.0,9.0,Big,I guess you've got it all figured out...,
262,1.0,9.0,Big,Mrs. Blatch.,
263,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"The more he mocked me, the more convinced I became that this idea was genius.",
264,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"That night, Miranda and I had plans to join Charlotte...",
265,1.0,9.0,Carrie,for a gallery opening in Chelsea when--,
266,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- Hello? ,
267,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"- Carrie, it's Charlotte.",
268,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"I'm really sorry, but I'm going to have to cancel.",
269,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,I'm totally wiped out.,
270,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Wiped out!,
271,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"That was Charlotte speak for ""I'm spending the night with my vibrator.""",
272,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,"But you guys have fun, though.",
273,1.0,9.0,Carrie,There was only one thing to do.,
274,1.0,9.0,Carrie,A rabbit intervention.,
275,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Come on, let's go!",
276,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"- Okay, where is it? ",
277,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,- What are you talking about?,
278,1.0,9.0,Miranda,The Rabbit. Give us the Rabbit.,
279,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Hey, it's a vibrator. It's not like it's crack.",
280,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Charlotte, you hid the Rabbit behind a stuffed rabbit? That is so you.",
281,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,You have a lot of nerve coming in here. You're the one who made me get it.,
282,1.0,9.0,Miranda,I thought you could handle it.,
283,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,It's no big deal. I'd just rather stay home with the Rabbit than go out with men.,
284,1.0,9.0,Charlotte,All right. You're right. I'll go get dressed.,
285,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"With a little help from her friends, Charlotte decided",
286,1.0,9.0,Carrie,that she wasn't going to settle for herself.,
287,1.0,9.0,Carrie,While Samantha was doing everything in her power to remake the Turtle,
288,1.0,9.0,Carrie,into a man she could fall in love with.,
289,1.0,9.0,Samantha,- How's your dinner? ,
290,1.0,9.0,Bernie,- It's questionable.,
291,1.0,9.0,Bernie,I can't figure out whether the mushrooms are shitake or chantrelle.,
292,1.0,9.0,Bernie,They're definitely not porcini.,
293,1.0,9.0,Bernie,Maybe they're wood ear.,
294,1.0,9.0,Samantha,Maybe it doesn't matter.,
295,1.0,9.0,Bernie,My God! They're trompettes!,
296,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"It was then that Samantha realized that even with all her effort,",
297,1.0,9.0,Carrie,he was still just the Turtle in black.,
298,1.0,9.0,Samantha,"You know, I'm not feeling very well.",
299,1.0,9.0,Samantha,I think I'm going to have to send myself home.,
300,1.0,9.0,Samantha,I'll call you.,
301,1.0,9.0,Bernie,Excuse me. Do you like this shirt?,
302,1.0,9.0,Bernie,My ex-girlfriend picked it out.,
303,1.0,9.0,Carrie,After 12 phone calls and three e-mails...,
304,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Stanford badgered me into at least meeting his grandmother.,
305,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I love that suit you're wearing.,
306,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,Designed by Coco Chanel herself.,
307,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- Seriously? ,
308,1.0,9.0,Stanford,- Grandmother's been wearing that same suit for 40 years.,
309,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,And it still fits.,
310,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,- It never goes out of style. ,
311,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- Never.,
312,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,"I have it in blue, black, pink.",
313,1.0,9.0,Stanford,And eggshell!,
314,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,Exactly.,
315,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,Stanford tells me you're a writer.,
316,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Yes, I have a column in The Star.",
317,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,"I was a career woman many, many years ago.",
318,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,But I gave it up to have children.,
319,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Oh, wow! ls this you?",
320,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,Not a bad-looking girl. Don't you think?,
321,1.0,9.0,Stanford,Doesn't she look exactly like Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember?,
322,1.0,9.0,Carrie,She does.,
323,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Oh, my God! This has to be Stanford.",
324,1.0,9.0,Carrie,- You're the same person.  ,
325,1.0,9.0,Stanford,- That's enough.,
326,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Come on. This is fun. I had no idea you had such a big family.,
327,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,"How about you, honey? Do you want a family?",
328,1.0,9.0,Carrie,As I looked around at all the memorabilia and family photographs...,
329,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"the faces of brides and grooms, children and grandchildren...",
330,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I realized--,
331,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Yes, I do.",
332,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,"Stanny, be a dear. Go in the kitchen and get me some matches.",
333,1.0,9.0,Stanford,Of course.,
334,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,I love my Stanford. He's a very sweet boy.,
335,1.0,9.0,Grandmother,"But you know, he is a fruit.",
336,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I realized then that the only inheritance Stanford was going to get from his grandmother...,
337,1.0,9.0,Carrie,was her collection of Chanel suits.,
338,1.0,9.0,Big,Salt. Yeah.,
339,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"That night at dinner, I knew I would have to break the news to Big.",
340,1.0,9.0,Big,What do you think?,
341,1.0,9.0,Carrie,I do want to get married someday.,
342,1.0,9.0,Carrie,Maybe not today.,
343,1.0,9.0,Carrie,But I don't want... I can't date somebody that won't. What's the point?,
344,1.0,9.0,Big,Definitely too much salt.,
345,1.0,9.0,Big,"I mean, it's all in the timing. You gotta brown the garlic...",
346,1.0,9.0,Big,"before you put in the onions, know what I mean?",
347,1.0,9.0,Big,I thought we were having fun.,
348,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"It's bitter, but it definitely has possibilities.",
349,1.0,9.0,Big,You have a little bit of sauce on the lip...,
350,1.0,9.0,Big,right there.,
351,1.0,9.0,Carrie,My Zen teacher also said the only way to true happiness...,
352,1.0,9.0,Carrie,is to live in the moment and not worry about the future.,
353,1.0,9.0,Carrie,"Of course, he died penniless and single.",
0,1.0,10.0,Carrie,Let's be honest.,
1,1.0,10.0,Carrie,Sometimes there is nothing harder in life than being happy for somebody else.,
2,1.0,10.0,Carrie,Like lottery winners or extremely successful people who are 27.,
3,1.0,10.0,Carrie,Then there's that hell on Earth...,
4,1.0,10.0,Carrie,that only your closest friends can inflict on you--,
5,1.0,10.0,Carrie,the baby shower.,
6,1.0,10.0,Miranda,You could not drag me to that thing if you put a grappling hook in my mouth.,
7,1.0,10.0,Samantha,"Frankly, I think it's sad, the way she's using a child to validate her existence.",
8,1.0,10.0,Carrie,Exactly. Why can't she just use sex and a nice cocktail like the rest of us?,
9,1.0,10.0,Charlotte,I'm happy for her... I am.,
10,1.0,10.0,Miranda,"If I see another crepe paper stork, I'm gonna rip its cardboard beak off.",
11,1.0,10.0,Carrie,"Can I ask you, would any baby shower bother you...",
12,1.0,10.0,Carrie,or is this one worse because it's Laney's?,
13,1.0,10.0,Carrie,Laney Berlin. You can't really describe her.,
14,1.0,10.0,Carrie,You just had to know her.,
15,1.0,10.0,Carrie,Chances are eight years ago you probably did.,
16,1.0,10.0,Samantha,"So help me, she fucks on my couch, she buys it.",
17,1.0,10.0,Carrie,Isn't that how you got the couch from me?,

70,1.0,12.0,Big,So?,
71,1.0,12.0,Carrie,God bless.,
72,1.0,12.0,Carrie,It was one of those awkward relationship moments...,
73,1.0,12.0,Carrie,where you feel like you know nothing about the person...,

82,1.0,12.0,Charlotte,- Oh my god. Is he still doing that?  ,
83,1.0,12.0,Miranda,- It's amazing he has any skin left.,

103,1.0,12.0,Carrie,Samantha uttering those words to us...,
104,1.0,12.0,Carrie,was an event as unfathomable...,
105,1.0,12.0,Carrie,as Moses parting the Red Sea.,
106,1.0,12.0,Carrie,It all started a couple of weeks ago...,
107,1.0,12.0,Carrie,on a particularly blah Wednesday night.,
108,1.0,12.0,Carrie,Samantha decided to treat herself to a night of great music.,

122,1.0,12.0,Samantha,Heavenly. And I never thought I'd get there.,
123,1.0,12.0,James,Why not? An angel like you?,
124,1.0,12.0,Carrie,And then Samantha did something rather shocking for a first date--,

126,1.0,12.0,Samantha,"Thanks, James.",
127,1.0,12.0,Samantha,I had a wonderful time.,

131,1.0,12.0,Carrie,who was never a believer in relationships...,
132,1.0,12.0,Carrie,suddenly became a convert.,

140,1.0,12.0,Samantha,All that bullshit you spout...,
141,1.0,12.0,Samantha,about not sleeping with men right away actually paid off.,

246,2.0,1.0,Miranda,All we talk about anymore is Big or balls or small dicks.,
247,2.0,1.0,Miranda,Why do four smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends? It's like seventh grade with bank accounts.,
248,2.0,1.0,Miranda,"What about us? What we think, we feel, we know Christ! Does it always have to be about them? Give me a call when you're ready to talk about something besides men for a change.",

266,2.0,1.0,Samantha,What are you doing back there? Let's go.,
267,2.0,1.0,Carrie,And like every good coach she passed on the benefits of her years of experience.,

274,2.0,1.0,Samantha,It's my vibrator. I thought it would be fun.,
275,2.0,1.0,James,I think just us might be more fun.,
276,2.0,1.0,James,"That's not a problem, is it? ",
277,2.0,1.0,Carrie,But there was no joy in Mudville. Mighty Samantha had struck out.,

279,2.0,1.0,Charlotte,I have a present for you.,
280,2.0,1.0,Paul Ericson,I thought you just gave me one.,

282,2.0,1.0,Charlotte,Here.,
283,2.0,1.0,Carrie,Charlotte had decided a possible solution to her problem might be as simple as briefs vs.,

289,2.0,1.0,Charlotte,It's not like that ,
290,2.0,1.0,Paul Ericson,It's what?,

269,2.0,2.0,Samantha,I'm just not feeling very sexual these days.,
270,2.0,2.0,James,I saw you masturbating the other day when I came out of the shower.,
271,2.0,2.0,Velma Rudin,Many women are simply unable to achieve orgasm through intercourse.,
272,2.0,2.0,Velma Rudin,It's nothing to be ashamed of.,
273,2.0,2.0,James,You have a problem with intimacy.,
274,2.0,2.0,Samantha,"No, that's not it.",
275,2.0,2.0,James,- What is it? ,

288,2.0,2.0,Samantha,What can I say? I need a big dick.,
289,2.0,2.0,Velma Rudin,I hear that.,
290,2.0,2.0,Carrie,As Samantha paid the price of mentioning the unmentionable Miranda discovered that free speech comes with a cost of its own.,
291,2.0,2.0,Miranda,I just love putting my hand around your cock.,
292,2.0,2.0,Aaron Melman,"I just love hearing you say ""cock.",

239,2.0,3.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, our smugness was a little premature.",
240,2.0,3.0,Luke,- What are you doing this weekend? ,
241,2.0,3.0,Miranda,- Big plans. I'm gonna go see my granddad in Connecticut.,

249,2.0,3.0,Luke,There is no world outside Manhattan.,
250,2.0,3.0,Carrie,I'd unwittingly set Miranda up on a date with Manhattan Guy.,

266,2.0,3.0,Miranda,He's obviously a freak.,

268,2.0,3.0,Miranda,You can tell everything about a person by who their friends are.,
269,2.0,3.0,Carrie,"God, I hope not.",

279,2.0,3.0,Ben,You're scrappy.,
280,2.0,3.0,Ben,I like scrappy.,
281,2.0,3.0,Carrie,And then The Amazing Tattooed Man made love to me.,
282,2.0,3.0,Carrie,And it didn't feel weird at all.,
283,2.0,3.0,Carrie,While Miranda was busy feeding her pussy Charlotte was trying to do everything but.,
284,2.0,3.0,Charlotte,Did you ever go to summer camp? ,
285,2.0,3.0,Carrie,"There, over the exotic-fruit plate Charlotte tried to make a relationship happen.",

289,2.0,3.0,Charlotte,I was always a Red.,
290,2.0,3.0,Charlotte,It was so much fun.,
291,2.0,3.0,Charlotte,And then they made us stop because they said that it glorified warfare.,
292,2.0,3.0,Charlotte,You're awfully quiet tonight.,
293,2.0,3.0,Carrie,What are you thinking about? Charlotte realized Miranda was right.,
294,2.0,3.0,Carrie,She had stayed too long at the fair.,
295,2.0,3.0,Carrie,"From that moment on, Charlotte couldn't be in the same room with a fig.",
296,2.0,3.0,Carrie,Some people might call that a little odd.,

320,2.0,3.0,Carrie,I had to find out what was wrong before I wasted the next six months.,

322,2.0,3.0,Carrie,I just wanted to see what the guy ate listened to dated.,

324,2.0,4.0,Carrie,There wasn't quite as much smoke uptown.,
325,2.0,4.0,Josh,How's that? Is that better now? How about now? ,
326,2.0,4.0,Carrie,Miranda's two-day tutorial with her ophthalmologist had turned lovemaking into a kind of naked eye exam.,
327,2.0,4.0,Miranda,Maybe we should just try and let it happen for a second.,
328,2.0,4.0,Josh,I wanna do it right.,
329,2.0,4.0,Josh,How's that?,

355,2.0,4.0,Charlotte,"Oh no, really? ",

357,2.0,4.0,Tom,My heart's still in acting.,
358,2.0,4.0,Tom,I'm not ready to let it go.,
359,2.0,4.0,Carrie,"Tom was faking, too.",
360,2.0,4.0,Carrie,He was mostly just sick of New York and needed an excuse to leave.,
361,2.0,4.0,Charlotte,I'll miss you.,
362,2.0,4.0,Tom,"I'll miss you, too.",
363,2.0,4.0,Carrie,It was a perfectly timed double fake.,

370,2.0,4.0,Carrie,"Samantha made peace with her feelings about ""we"" William.",
371,2.0,4.0,Carrie,And Charlotte learned you don 't have to rely on men 's affections to get things fixed around the house.,
372,2.0,4.0,Carrie,You can pay them.,
373,2.0,4.0,Carrie,"As for me, after I was recycled I decided instead of running away from the idea of a life alone I'd better sit down and take that fear to lunch.",

12,2.0,5.0,Samantha,You like?,
13,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Isn't it a little wrong to wear a dead man's design to his own funeral?,
14,2.0,5.0,Samantha,It's wrong not to.,
15,2.0,5.0,Samantha,"Besides, at $2,000, I better get some wear out of it.",
16,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"$2,000? You're kidding.",

30,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,That dress is really inappropriate.,
31,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Apparently, Charlotte and I were the inappropriate ones.",

87,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,He's in touch with his emotions.,
88,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,It's kind of romantic.,

91,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,It shows he can commit.,
92,2.0,5.0,Samantha,Then date a divorced guy.,
93,2.0,5.0,Samantha,They've committed and everyone's still alive.,
94,2.0,5.0,Carrie,It didn't work for Big.,
95,2.0,5.0,Carrie,All marriage did was convince him he hated committing.,
96,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,You broke up with him.,
97,2.0,5.0,Carrie,So I'm the one with the commitment problem? ,
98,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,I'm just saying,

138,2.0,5.0,Samantha,We'd love to have you on the Javier House board.,
139,2.0,5.0,Samantha,Maybe in this case you can make an exception?,
140,2.0,5.0,Richard 'Dick' Cranwell, I'll tell you what's exceptional. Getting solicited by a woman as beautiful as you.,
141,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Richard Cranwell, senior partner at Bear Sterns philanthropist, playboy.",x

148,2.0,5.0,Richard 'Dick' Cranwell,Perhaps we could discuss Javier House over dinner sometime.,
149,2.0,5.0,Samantha,I believe that could be arranged.,
150,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Samantha groped Dick Cranwell for the good of all strung-out designers everywhere.,
151,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, she was not expecting Sandy Cranwell back early from groping a sweater set at Bendels.",
152,2.0,5.0,Sandy Cranwell,Get out.,
153,2.0,5.0,Samantha,I'll just leave the proposal.,

172,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,"If you own and he still rents, then the power structure is all off.",
173,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,It's emasculating.,
174,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,Men don't want a woman who's too self-sufficient.,
175,2.0,5.0,Samantha,"I'm sorry, did someone just order a Victorian straight up? ",

195,2.0,5.0,Ned,"Let's get out of here, okay?",
196,2.0,5.0,Charlotte, I'm sorry. That was really thoughtless of me.,

222,2.0,5.0,Carrie,So how was the sex? ,
223,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,"Amazing. It was like Liz was looking over us, giving us her blessing.",
224,2.0,5.0,Carrie,A threesome in absentia.,
225,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,"I mean, my hat blew right into her headstone.",
226,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,She was clearly sending a message.,
227,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"Yeah, ""don't fuck my husband, you hat-Ioving bitch.",
228,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,""" He invited me to a memorial service at her grave next week.",
229,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,That is huge.,
230,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Excuse me, but when did cemeteries get so happening? ",
231,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,It's a sign that he's ready to move on.And he's ready to do it with me.,
232,2.0,5.0,Miranda,You're saying you fucked him back to life? ,
233,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,"In a way, yes.",
234,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Man, you're good.",
235,2.0,5.0,Carrie,That night I had my date with Big.,
236,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"I was feeling everything fear, happiness, dread.",
237,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Was I ready to jump back into a life with Big in it? Was seeing him again a huge mistake? And if it was why was I so excited? I had never felt so confused.,
238,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Was Charlotte right? In a world where everyone's dying to make a connection can a relationship bring you back to life?,
239,2.0,5.0,Big,I never really thought about it.,
240,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Come on, everybody wonders what happens after you die.",
241,2.0,5.0,Big,I'm too busy wondering who's dinging my car in the garage.,
242,2.0,5.0,Carrie,I think we reincarnate.,
243,2.0,5.0,Big,That's the easy way out.,
244,2.0,5.0,Big,What are you gonna come back as? ,
245,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Someone who knows better.,
246,2.0,5.0,Big,You smell nice.,
247,2.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm serious.,
248,2.0,5.0,Carrie,- Do you believe in heaven? ,
249,2.0,5.0,Big,- Yeah.,
250,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Really? What's your idea of heaven? ,
251,2.0,5.0,Big,"A big bed. And they're just saying, ""Come on in.",
252,2.0,5.0,Carrie,""" You're idea of heaven is a bed? ",
253,2.0,5.0,Big,It depends on who's in it.,
254,2.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm not sleeping with you tonight.,
255,2.0,5.0,Big,I thought we were just having dinner.,
256,2.0,5.0,Carrie,We are.,
257,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"A half hour later, and I was back at Big's, the site of so many past little deaths.",
258,2.0,5.0,Carrie,It felt great and weird and wrong.,
259,2.0,5.0,Carrie,- We can't do this.,
260,2.0,5.0,Big,"- Yes, we can.",
261,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Not like this.,
262,2.0,5.0,Big,"You're right, let's go inside.",
263,2.0,5.0,Carrie,No.,
264,2.0,5.0,Carrie,I have to go.,
265,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"I didn 't know what had happened but suddenly, getting back together with Big seemed like a very bad idea.",
266,2.0,5.0,Carrie,I was scared to death.,
267,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"The first time we got involved, I got out just in time.",
268,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Would I be as lucky the second? Across town, Samantha was facing her own uncertain future.",
269,2.0,5.0,Samantha,- Check it again: Samantha Jones.,
270,2.0,5.0,Bouncer,- Sorry.,
271,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"The first time, she thought it was an unfortunate oversight.",
272,2.0,5.0,Carrie,The second time was just unfortunate.,
273,2.0,5.0,Hostess,"- I'm sorry, we're all full.",
274,2.0,5.0,Samantha,- I'll wait for a table.,
275,2.0,5.0,Hostess,Don't bother.,
276,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"By the third time she was turned away, it had all become clear.",
277,2.0,5.0,Carrie,She was deader in this town than Javier.,
278,2.0,5.0,Assistant,"Teddy, take her out of here.",
279,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"The next day, Miranda met her new neighbor.",
280,2.0,5.0,Older Woman,Hello! Are you my new neighbor? ,
281,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"Yeah. Hi, I'm Miranda Hobbes.",
282,2.0,5.0,Miranda,Nice to meet you.,
283,2.0,5.0,Miranda,I haven't actually moved in yet.,
284,2.0,5.0,Miranda,I'm just taking some measurements.,
285,2.0,5.0,Older Woman,I'm so glad to have a young person moving in.,
286,2.0,5.0,Older Woman,Brings a little life to the place.,
287,2.0,5.0,Older Woman,Ruthie kept pretty much to herself.,
288,2.0,5.0,Older Woman,Never married.,
289,2.0,5.0,Older Woman,"She died in there, you know.",
290,2.0,5.0,Miranda,She did?,
291,2.0,5.0,Older Woman," Oh, yes. It was a week before anyone realized she passed.",
292,2.0,5.0,Older Woman,"Rumor has it, the cat ate half her face. So, just you? ",
293,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"That night, Miranda had another disconcerting experience.",
294,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Halfway through her Three Delicacy Delight a delicacy got stuck.,
295,2.0,5.0,Carrie,After Miranda was done saving her own life she called someone who could commiserate.,
296,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, I was deep into screening mode.",
297,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Big had called twice and I didn't know what I wanted to say to him.,
298,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"Oh my God, I just choked! I just almost died and you are not ",
299,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Hey, sweetie, you all right?",
300,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"I was watching Hard Copy, and I kept thinking when they found me I would forever be the dead girl who watched bad TV.",
301,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Why didn't you call me? ,
302,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"I couldn't breathe. I'm gonna die alone, Carrie.",
303,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"No, you are not.",
304,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Do you want me to come over?,
305,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"No, I'm okay. I'll call you tomorrow.",
306,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"The fact was, Miranda was not okay.",
307,2.0,5.0,Carrie,She went to bed hungry and locked the cat in the kitchen for two days.,
308,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"After a week of being a social pariah Samantha realized if she ever wanted to get her life back, she'd have to beg for it.",
309,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"She went to the top, the Godfather.",
310,2.0,5.0,Shippy Shipman,Samantha Jones.,
311,2.0,5.0,Shippy Shipman,The name sounds familiar.,
312,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Shippy Shipman was the queen of the ladies who lunch.,
313,2.0,5.0,Carrie,And was personally responsible for the demise of at least 70 social lives.,
314,2.0,5.0,Samantha,You might know me from the Javier House Foundation? ,
315,2.0,5.0,Shippy Shipman,"No, that's not it.",
316,2.0,5.0,Samantha,No? ,
317,2.0,5.0,Shippy Shipman,I believe you were the whore who once groped my husband at a Whitney benefit.,
318,2.0,5.0,Carrie,It was bad.,
319,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Not only was Samantha dying but her entire sex life was flashing before her.,
320,2.0,5.0,Samantha,Maybe.,
321,2.0,5.0,Samantha,I don't really remember.,
322,2.0,5.0,Shippy Shipman,I do.,
323,2.0,5.0,Samantha,You're good friends with Sandy Cranwell? ,
324,2.0,5.0,Shippy Shipman,"Yes, we go back to Chapin.",
325,2.0,5.0,Samantha,Could you maybe talk to her for me? ,
326,2.0,5.0,Shippy Shipman,"I think you made your own bed and you need to lie in it. And you're good at that, aren't you, Samantha? ",
327,2.0,5.0,Samantha,"What do you want me to say, Shippy? That I'm a whore? That I've slept with every man in New York and some in Brooklyn? All right, maybe I have.",
328,2.0,5.0,Samantha,"Is that what it's gonna take? Okay, I'm a big whore. Now, will you help me? ",
329,2.0,5.0,Shippy Shipman,I don't think so.,
330,2.0,5.0,Samantha,Fine.,
331,2.0,5.0,Samantha,And I only groped your husband's flat preppy ass at that benefit because I was drunk.,
332,2.0,5.0,Samantha,I'll see myself out.,
333,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"The next day, Miranda decided to check out her new neighborhood.",
334,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"But suddenly, she was the one checking out.",
335,2.0,5.0,Carrie,That was the peculiar thing about New York you never knew if a cab was going to save you or kill you,
336,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, please.",
337,2.0,5.0,Carrie,or both.,
338,2.0,5.0,Miranda,That was freaky.,
339,2.0,5.0,Miranda,I felt like I was drowning and dying at the same time.,
340,2.0,5.0,Carrie,They said you had a panic attack.,
341,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"Yeah, and I had to pay $500 of my single person's salary to find that out.",
342,2.0,5.0,Carrie,What's wrong? ,
343,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"Take a good look at my face, because at my funeral there'll only be half of it. I'll be dead and my cat will be happy.",
344,2.0,5.0,Miranda,Charlotte will be picking up men at the next grave site over.,
345,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Breathe, sweetie, breathe.",
346,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"I'm all alone, Carrie.",
347,2.0,5.0,Miranda,"The first people on my ""call in case of emergency"" list are my parents.",
348,2.0,5.0,Miranda,And I don't like them.,
349,2.0,5.0,Miranda,And they live in Pennsylvania.,
350,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Sweetie, you can put me on there.",
351,2.0,5.0,Miranda,I can't! You screen! ,
352,2.0,5.0,Carrie,I'll pick up. I promise.,
353,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Listen you did the right thing buying that apartment. - You love it, right? ",
354,2.0,5.0,Miranda,- Yeah.,
355,2.0,5.0,Carrie,And you won't be alone forever.,
356,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"The truth was, I didn't know if any of us would end up alone.",
357,2.0,5.0,Carrie,But I did know Miranda couldn't afford another panic attack.,
358,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, over in Queens Charlotte was about to get a surprise of her own.",
359,2.0,5.0,Ned,You brought lilies.,
360,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,You said they were her favorite.,
361,2.0,5.0,Charlotte,Please tell me those are your sisters.,
362,2.0,5.0,Ned,I don't have any sisters.,
363,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Charlotte realized she wasn't the only woman resuscitating Ned.,
364,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Charlotte's relationship died right where it started.,
365,2.0,5.0,Carrie,She was prepared to live in the shadow of a dead woman.,
366,2.0,5.0,Carrie,She wasn 't prepared to live in the shadow of three live ones.,
367,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"That Saturday, Samantha hit rock bottom also known as Javier House.",
368,2.0,5.0,Carrie,No one would return her phone calls.,
369,2.0,5.0,Carrie,She hadn 't raised any money.,
370,2.0,5.0,Carrie,All she could do for Javier House was construct it.,
371,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"But six hours of hard labor later, Samantha experienced her own rebirth.",
372,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"It was Leonardo DiCaprio, ex machina.",
373,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"That day, Leonardo and Samantha became fast friends.",
374,2.0,5.0,Carrie,The nightmare was over.,
375,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Leonardo DiCaprio had brought Sam back to social life.,
376,2.0,5.0,Carrie,To add insult to panic attack Miranda had just gotten some unsettling news.,
377,2.0,5.0,Carrie,The mortgage officer had messed up Miranda's application.,
378,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"They had inadvertently labeled her as ""separated.",
379,2.0,5.0,Carrie,""" And to clear up the confusion Miranda had to write a rather humiliating letter.",
380,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Miranda had a choice.,
381,2.0,5.0,Carrie,She could panic or she could just type.,
382,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Miranda killed her panic attacks right then and there.,
383,2.0,5.0,Carrie,She realized she probably wouldn't die alone.,
384,2.0,5.0,Carrie,But she kept overfeeding her cat just in case.,
385,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, four unreturned calls later, my number was up.",
386,2.0,5.0,Big,"Good, you're alive.",
387,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Wait, where are you going? ",
388,2.0,5.0,Big,Home. I'm old.,
389,2.0,5.0,Big,It's past my bedtime.,
390,2.0,5.0,Carrie,- I'm sorry.,
391,2.0,5.0,Big,- You should be.,
392,2.0,5.0,Big,I had box seats to a Yankee double header.,
393,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Damn! Who'd you take? ,
394,2.0,5.0,Big,Someone who returned my calls.,
395,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"It was deja vu all over again: Me, Big, a doorway and mixed emotions.",
396,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Wait, not here.",
397,2.0,5.0,Big,"Don't do this, Carrie.",
398,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Come on.,
399,2.0,5.0,Carrie,We're going out.,
400,2.0,5.0,Carrie,I took him to the most non-sexual place I could think of.,
401,2.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm good! - Did you see that? ,
402,2.0,5.0,Big,"- Wow, I sure did.",
403,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Two pitchers of cheap beer later, Big and I were having a great time.",
404,2.0,5.0,Big,You know what my version of hell is? Wearing rented two-tone shoes.,
405,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Hey, batter batter! ",
406,2.0,5.0,Big,No heckling the bowler. Did you see that? ,
407,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Yeah. That was nice.,
408,2.0,5.0,Big,Look at that.,
409,2.0,5.0,Big,I won.,
410,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Okay, two out of three.",
411,2.0,5.0,Big,You want to play a second game? ,
412,2.0,5.0,Carrie,Maybe.,
413,2.0,5.0,Big,Are you sure you're ready to get killed all over again? ,
414,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"I didn't know what we were talking about anymore. But either way, I knew the answer.",
415,2.0,5.0,Carrie,"Yep, let's do it.",
416,2.0,5.0,Carrie,We never made it to the second game.,
417,2.0,5.0,Carrie,I didn't know if it was suicide or not.,
418,2.0,5.0,Carrie,All I knew was Big and I had been reincarnated and I'd never felt more alive.,
0,2.0,6.0,Carrie,They say that New Yorkers will attend the opening of an envelope as long as the champagne doesn't run dry.,
1,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"But tonight's opening at Charlotte's gallery for Yael a lesbian painter from Brooklyn Heights actually transcended the bad wine, stale cheese routine.",
2,2.0,6.0,Carrie,It was lesbian chic meets art-world cool.,
3,2.0,6.0,Carrie,A surprisingly fabulous combustion that no one saw coming.,
4,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"Charlotte was there with her latest fling, Gareth Davis.",
5,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"A toxic bachelor and the owner of Thorn, a downtown restaurant frequented by second-tier models and the men who buy them salad.",
6,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Miranda brought Ethan Watson a documentary filmmaker she had met the week before at a sparsely attended Harvard Alumni mixer.,x
7,2.0,6.0,Carrie,And my date for the evening was Samantha.,
8,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Not entirely inappropriate given the circumstances.,
9,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Here.,
10,2.0,6.0,Samantha,Nobody told me it was B.Y.O.Man,
11,2.0,6.0,Carrie,What did you expect? It's a lesbian art show.,
12,2.0,6.0,Samantha,But don't straight guys follow them around to see what they're going to do? Wait a second.,
13,2.0,6.0,Samantha,You see that guy? -  ,
14,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Who?,
15,2.0,6.0,Samantha,- I know him.,
16,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- Who is he? ,
17,2.0,6.0,Samantha,- He's a trainer at my gym. And you should see his squat thrusts.,x
18,2.0,6.0,Samantha,I'm just gonna say hello.,
19,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"You know what, honey? I think I'm gonna go home.",
20,2.0,6.0,Samantha,"- Relax, I'll be right back.",
21,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- I don't feel very well.,
22,2.0,6.0,Samantha,- What's wrong? ,
23,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- I have a headache. It just hit me.,
24,2.0,6.0,Samantha,- You want a Percodan? - I'm fine.,
25,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I just need some sleep.,
26,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"Go on, make new friends.",
27,2.0,6.0,Samantha,- I'll call you.,
28,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- Okay.,
29,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"With Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte all suitably occupied I figured there was no better time to make my escape.",
30,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"The truth was, I had another engagement.",
31,2.0,6.0,Carrie,But I didn't dare tell any of my friends where I was going or who I was planning to meet.,
32,2.0,6.0,Big,Wow. You look sensational.,
33,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- You don't look so bad yourself.,
34,2.0,6.0,Big,This old thing? I've had it for years.,
35,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I knew it was wrong.,
36,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Seeing an emotionally unavailable man I had sworn off months earlier.,
37,2.0,6.0,Carrie,But the guilt worked like an aphrodisiac.,
38,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I had never felt sexier or more alive in my entire life.,
39,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"By midnight, Charlotte discovered Manhattan 's latest group to flaunt their disposable income: The power lesbian.",

45,2.0,6.0,Lydia,- I thought you were taking the large one.,
46,2.0,6.0,Eileen,- I want both.,
47,2.0,6.0,Lydia,For God's sakes.,
48,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Charlotte had never sold out a show before in her life.,
49,2.0,6.0,Carrie,She was pleasantly surprised.,
50,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, there was a not so pleasant surprise in store for her.",
51,2.0,6.0,Gallery Attendant,We're out of champagne.,
52,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,I'm sure I have an extra case or two in the back storeroom.,
53,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Excuse me.,
54,2.0,6.0,Gareth Davis,"Relax, we're just kissing.",
55,2.0,6.0,Gareth Davis,I'll see you in there.,
56,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,I can't believe he had the nerve to kiss her and still pretend he wasn't cheating.,
57,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Maybe he doesn't consider kissing cheating.,
58,2.0,6.0,Samantha,Come on.,
59,2.0,6.0,Samantha,It was only your second date.,
60,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,So? Doesn't that guarantee me fidelity until the end of the evening? ,
61,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"Remember Ron, the married guy with kids on Park Avenue? He didn't consider fucking below 23rd Street cheating.",
62,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,That's insane.,
63,2.0,6.0,Samantha,Men cheat for the same reason that dogs lick their balls: Because they can.,
64,2.0,6.0,Samantha,It's part of their biology.,
65,2.0,6.0,Samantha,Instead of wasting all this energy condemning it maybe it's time we all got in line with the reality of the situation.,
66,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"That sounds very empowering, but you're forgetting one detail.",
67,2.0,6.0,Miranda,I hope so.,
68,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- Women cheat.,
69,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,- But it's completely different.,
70,2.0,6.0,Samantha,How? ,
71,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,We don't go around randomly attacking any man we're attracted to.,
72,2.0,6.0,Samantha,- Speak for yourself.,
73,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,- We're not driven by testosterone.,
74,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Then what does drive us according to you?,
75,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,- Emotions.,
76,2.0,6.0,Samantha,- You mean hormones.,
77,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,No.,

79,2.0,6.0,Samantha,""" You can't listen to every fucking little voice that runs through your head.",
80,2.0,6.0,Samantha,It'll drive you nuts.,
81,2.0,6.0,Carrie,The problem is that you two have very different definitions of cheating.,
82,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,I don't tolerate it.,
83,2.0,6.0,Samantha,And I'm more forgiving and realistic about human nature.,
84,2.0,6.0,Miranda,That's because you cheat.,
85,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I just don't think that you can define cheating in absolute terms.,
86,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,You think it's okay to cheat?,
87,2.0,6.0,Carrie, I think maybe there's a cheating curve. Someone's definition of what constitutes cheating is in direct proportion to how much they themselves want to cheat.,
88,2.0,6.0,Miranda,That's moral relativism.,
89,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I prefer to think of it as quantum cheating.,
90,2.0,6.0,Samantha,"The fact is, the act of cheating is defined by the act of getting caught.",
91,2.0,6.0,Samantha,One doesn't exist without the other.,
92,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"I wondered, was Samantha right? Is cheating like the proverbial tree in the forest? That it doesn't exist if there's no one around to catch you? In a gravity-free world of anything goes, what constitutes cheating? ",

97,2.0,6.0,Samantha,I guess I better behave then.,
98,2.0,6.0,Thor,I'm all about form and discipline.,
99,2.0,6.0,Thor,Do it right or don't bother doing it at all.,
100,2.0,6.0,Samantha,Yes.,
101,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Samantha realized that while purity of form exacted a price it also had its own rewards.,
102,2.0,6.0,Thor,So how do you feel?,
103,2.0,6.0,Samantha, You got me all wet. I mean sweaty.,
104,2.0,6.0,Thor,Same time on Wednesday? ,
105,2.0,6.0,Samantha,It's a date,
106,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"Later that day, Charlotte realized she was tired of listening to another man 's weak justifications.",
107,2.0,6.0,Gareth Davis,You don 't understand.,
108,2.0,6.0,Gareth Davis,She's a friend of my sister's from college.,
109,2.0,6.0,Gareth Davis,She just moved to the city and her uncle died last month.,
110,2.0,6.0,Gareth Davis,I was just trying to be supportive.,
111,2.0,6.0,Gareth Davis,Besides you're the one I want to sleep with.,
112,2.0,6.0,Carrie,When she felt her life take a fortuitous turn.,
113,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,"Gareth, I've got to go.",
114,2.0,6.0,Gareth Davis,Wait. What ,
115,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Hi! Nice to see you.,
116,2.0,6.0,Lydia,I just came in to pay for my painting.,
117,2.0,6.0,Eileen,It's her painting for six months and then she's selling it back to me.,
118,2.0,6.0,Lydia,Excuse me.,
119,2.0,6.0,Lydia,I'm the one with the big loft and all the empty white walls.,
120,2.0,6.0,Lydia,Look at it.,
121,2.0,6.0,Lydia,I am so excited.,
122,2.0,6.0,Eileen,Excuse me.,
123,2.0,6.0,Eileen,"By the way, I love the Prada loafers.",
124,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Thanks.,
125,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Power lesbians and their shoes are like Wall Street brokers and their cigars.,
126,2.0,6.0,Lydia,Alice told me so many nice things about you.,
127,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,How long have you been doing the art thing? Ten years.,
128,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,"No, 12 years.",
129,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,I'm losing track.,
130,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Almost five years at this gallery.,
131,2.0,6.0,Lydia,What do you do? I'm a V.,
132,2.0,6.0,Lydia,P.,
133,2.0,6.0,Lydia,At Warner Music.,
134,2.0,6.0,Lydia,Eileen works on Wall Street.,
135,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,How long have you been together? ,
136,2.0,6.0,Lydia,Used to be together. Five years.,
137,2.0,6.0,Lydia,We're just friends now.,
138,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,That is so cool.,
139,2.0,6.0,Eileen,Want to join Melissa and Drew in about an hour for a drink? Sure.,
140,2.0,6.0,Lydia,Would you like to join us for a drink? ,
141,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,"I wish I could, but",
142,2.0,6.0,Lydia,But what?,
143,2.0,6.0,Carrie,The truth is Charlotte couldn't think of one really good reason not to go.,
144,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,I'd love to.,
145,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"One drink at G-Spot, the hottest new girl bar in town followed by dinner and scintillating conversation at Luke's a hot new French-fusion restaurant with an even hotter chef followed by late-night dancing at Love Tunnel left Charlotte exhilarated and happy as she'd been in ages.",
146,2.0,6.0,Carrie,There was something relaxing and liberating in traveling in an alternate universe that contained no thought of men.,
147,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"By the end of the night, Charlotte had truly made some wonderful new friends.",
148,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"That night, Miranda was exhausted from her own night on the town.",
149,2.0,6.0,Carrie,She had spent the last four hours in the dark with Ethan watching the classic holocaust documentary Shoah.,
150,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,"Shoah is so much better than that faky, stagy Schindler's List.",
151,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,Narrative film can't begin to touch the horror of experience.,
152,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,Only documentaries can really begin to capture the truth.,
153,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,"In fact, the entire concept of narrative film is just bogus.",
154,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,You know Want to come back to my place? ,
155,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Miranda was pleased to discover that Ethan was as passionate in bed as he was on the subject of non-narrative film. But just as they were getting down to business Miranda realized they were not alone.,
156,2.0,6.0,Miranda,What's that for? Just something to get us in the mood.,
157,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,"I think it's kind of sexy, don't you? ",
158,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"Yeah, I guess it could be.",
159,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Miranda realized that Ethan's passion for film had taken on a new and interesting twist.,
160,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"A few nights later, after a late show of Gimme Shelter at the Waverly Miranda discovered that Ethan's new friends were hard to shake.",
161,2.0,6.0,Miranda,- Does that really need to be on?,
162,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson, - No. It just really turns me on.,
163,2.0,6.0,Miranda,- Aren't I enough? ,
164,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,- You're great. I can turn off the sound if it bugs you.,
165,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,Could you move your head a bit to the right? ,
166,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Yeah.,
167,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,That's great.,
168,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"That night, in Mr.",
169,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"Big's kitchen, I performed an unnatural act of my own.",
170,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I cooked.,
171,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Voila.,
172,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Fondue.,
173,2.0,6.0,Big,You didn't cook.,
174,2.0,6.0,Big,You just heated up cheese.,
175,2.0,6.0,Carrie,And tore up little pieces of bread.,
176,2.0,6.0,Big,- I'm touched by your effort.,
177,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- Okay.,
178,2.0,6.0,Carrie,It's the only recipe I could ever master.,
179,2.0,6.0,Carrie,All righty.,
180,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Now tell me you love it.,
181,2.0,6.0,Big,Tasty.,
182,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Now you tell me.,
183,2.0,6.0,Carrie,It's horrible.,
184,2.0,6.0,Big,Can we go to a restaurant now? ,
185,2.0,6.0,Big,I take it back. You're an excellent cook.,
186,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I haven't told my friends we're seeing each other.,
187,2.0,6.0,Big,Neither have I.,
188,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- That doesn't count.,
189,2.0,6.0,Carrie,You have no friends.,
190,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- I have interested parties.,
191,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- Why haven't you told them? ,
192,2.0,6.0,Big,- I sensed you didn't want me to.,
193,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Bullshit.,
194,2.0,6.0,Big,What do you want me to tell people?,
195,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- Nothing.,
196,2.0,6.0,Big,- Good idea. Let's keep it quiet.,
197,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- Why do you want to keep it quiet? ,
198,2.0,6.0,Big,- I just want to be agreeable.,
199,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"The truth is, I wasn't sure why I wanted to keep the fact that I was seeing Big again so under wraps.",
200,2.0,6.0,Carrie,All I knew is that it felt somehow illicit.,
201,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I didn 't even want to be caught waking up there.,
202,2.0,6.0,Carrie,That morning at 7:00 a.,
203,2.0,6.0,Carrie,M as I walked the Walk of Shame back to my apartment ,
204,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Carrie?,
205,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"Miranda, oh my god! - ",
206,2.0,6.0,Miranda,What are you doing up here? ,
207,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- Teeth cleaning.,
208,2.0,6.0,Miranda,- At 7:00 a.m.?,
209,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- I like to get it over with. How's Ethan?,
210,2.0,6.0,Miranda, - Aside from his porn addiction? -  ,
211,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Still?,
212,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"It was kind of sexy at first, but it's getting borderline humiliating. ""Move your head here.",
213,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Move your head there.,
214,2.0,6.0,Miranda,""" Isn't the real thing more exciting than a tape? ",
215,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Maybe it's a force of habit.,
216,2.0,6.0,Miranda,I get the feeling he's more interested in the video than me.,
217,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Like he's cheating on me with them while we're having sex.,
218,2.0,6.0,Miranda,I don't know.,
219,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Am I expecting too much? ,
220,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"No, you deserve his undivided attention.",
221,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Thank you.,
222,2.0,6.0,Miranda,I have to go.,
223,2.0,6.0,Miranda,I have a breakfast meeting.,
224,2.0,6.0,Miranda,- You're dressed up for the dentist! - ,
225,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Laundry day.,
226,2.0,6.0,Miranda,- Got it.,
227,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"- Bye, sweetie.",
228,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Bye,
229,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I felt horrible.,
230,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I had never lied to Miranda before.,
231,2.0,6.0,Carrie,But I was embarrassed to admit that I was seeing Big again.,
232,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"The truth was, I was cheating on her and all my friends with Mr.",
233,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Big.,
234,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"That afternoon, Samantha got very personal with her new trainer, Thor.",
235,2.0,6.0,Samantha,I feel like such a cliche.,
236,2.0,6.0,Samantha,I bet you sleep with all your clients.,
237,2.0,6.0,Thor,"I really don't, but it's always been kind of a fantasy for me.",
238,2.0,6.0,Samantha,- Maybe I could train you.,
239,2.0,6.0,Thor,- Why don't we take a shower first? You got great legs.,
240,2.0,6.0,Samantha,"If I knew we were going to be doing this, I'd have shaved them.",
241,2.0,6.0,Thor,That's all right.,
242,2.0,6.0,Thor,I'll shave them for you.,
243,2.0,6.0,Thor,Are you a dirty girl? I guess that depends on your definition of dirty.,
244,2.0,6.0,Carrie,And then to Samantha's surprise and delight Thor kept right on shaving.,
245,2.0,6.0,Samantha,What is this thing guys have these days about wanting to shave your pubic hair? ,
246,2.0,6.0,Miranda,It's obvious. They want a little girl.,
247,2.0,6.0,Samantha,"Actually, in Thor's case, it was more like being branded.",
248,2.0,6.0,Miranda,What are you talking about? ,
249,2.0,6.0,Samantha,He shaved me in a shape: A lightning bolt.,
250,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"Where do you find these guys? Carrie, are you listening to this? That very personal trainer of Samantha's shaved her crotch in the shape of a lightening bolt.",
251,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Really.,
252,2.0,6.0,Carrie,It's very creative.,
253,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Sort of like X marks the spot.,
254,2.0,6.0,Samantha,"You know, it's a very neglected area.",
255,2.0,6.0,Samantha,But people are really starting to pay attention.,
256,2.0,6.0,Samantha,You can't just let it grow wild.,
257,2.0,6.0,Samantha,There's an entire business devoted to the upkeep and management of pubic hair.,
258,2.0,6.0,Samantha,It says as much about you as shoes.,
259,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"Congratulations, it sounds like you found yourself a very talented stylist.",
260,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Carrie What are you doing in there? ,
261,2.0,6.0,Carrie,You know what? Can somebody get that? I'll be out in a sec.,
262,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Sorry I'm late.,
263,2.0,6.0,Samantha,You didn't have to get all dressed up for us.,
264,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Why not? You did your hair.,
265,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,It's not for you guys.,
266,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,I'm meeting Lydia and her friends tonight.,
267,2.0,6.0,Samantha,- Who's Lydia? ,
268,2.0,6.0,Miranda,- Haven't you heard? Charlotte's a lesbian.,
269,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,I am not a lesbian.,
270,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,I just have some new lesbian friends.,
271,2.0,6.0,Miranda,She's been out with them three times this past week.,
272,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,So? They're cool and they buy art and their lives aren't complicated by men.,
273,2.0,6.0,Miranda,I was a major lesbian in the fourth grade.,
274,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Wendy Kirsten.,
275,2.0,6.0,Miranda,We kissed.,
276,2.0,6.0,Miranda,It was nice.,
277,2.0,6.0,Samantha,"They know you're straight, right?",
278,2.0,6.0,Charlotte," I'm sure they do, but we don't even talk about sex. It's a non-issue.",
279,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"You have to tell them, otherwise you're just leading them on.",
280,2.0,6.0,Samantha,You're nothing but a big clit tease.,
281,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Are you saying that a straight woman and a gay woman can't be friends? ,
282,2.0,6.0,Samantha,"Of course, but you can't expect to move to Wonder Woman's island and not go native.",
283,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Where's Carrie? ,
284,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"If she doesn't get out of the bathroom, we'll miss the movie.",
285,2.0,6.0,Samantha,Is everything okay in there? ,
286,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"Actually, no. I need help.",
287,2.0,6.0,Carrie,This is embarrassing.,
288,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I got a new diaphragm and it's stuck.,
289,2.0,6.0,Miranda,How long has it been in there? ,
290,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Since last night.,
291,2.0,6.0,Miranda,While you were getting your teeth cleaned this morning it was --,
292,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I'm either gonna have to make an emergency visit to my gynecologist or someone's gonna have to help me.,
293,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"I'd help you, but I'm not very dexterous.",
294,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"You're the lesbian, go in there.",
295,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,No.,
296,2.0,6.0,Samantha,Go.,
297,2.0,6.0,Samantha,And I just had my nails done.,
298,2.0,6.0,Samantha,You are so buying me dinner.,
299,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Wait.,
300,2.0,6.0,Miranda,Aren't we skipping a beat here? Who are you sleeping with? ,
301,2.0,6.0,Carrie,It's something that started again a few weeks ago. I don't know if it's real so I didn't want to say anything.,
302,2.0,6.0,Carrie,It's Big.,
303,2.0,6.0,Miranda,You're sleeping with Big? He was such an asshole to you.,
304,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Not really.,
305,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Maybe sometimes.,
306,2.0,6.0,Samantha,Why do you think it'll be different this time? ,
307,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"I don't know. I'm not sure they are, but it kind of feels okay.",
308,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"If it feels okay, why are you sneaking around?",
309,2.0,6.0,Carrie," We've got this physical, chemical kind of connection that's hard to shake. So lay off, okay? -",
310,2.0,6.0,Miranda, Now it's gonna be a casual sex thing? ,
311,2.0,6.0,Carrie,- Maybe.,
312,2.0,6.0,Samantha,- That's gonna work.,
313,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,- Even I am not that naive.,
314,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I'm really not in the mood to see a movie anymore.,
315,2.0,6.0,Group,Come on! ,
316,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"I couldn't sleep at all that night. The problem was, my friends were right.",
317,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"Falling into this casual thing with Big, without a sense of what happened or where it was going, suddenly felt like a huge mistake.",
318,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"The next morning, Charlotte attended brunch at the home of Patty Aston the ex-wife of a Hollywood television producer.",
319,2.0,6.0,Carrie,If power lesbians represented Manhattan 's chicest new social hive Charlotte was about to meet their queen bee.,
320,2.0,6.0,Lydia,Patty is an amazing lady.,
321,2.0,6.0,Lydia,She's on the board of 100 charities and now she's taking flying lessons.,
322,2.0,6.0,Lydia,She's got a house in Telluride.,
323,2.0,6.0,Lydia,We're all going there for Easter.,
324,2.0,6.0,Lydia,- You should come.,
325,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,- I'd love to.,
326,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,She also has some very interesting art.,
327,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,Diana the Huntress.,
328,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,I got her on sale.,
329,2.0,6.0,Lydia,This is Charlotte.,
330,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,A pleasure.,
331,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,I've heard so many wonderful things about you.,
332,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Likewise.,
333,2.0,6.0,Lydia,I was telling Charlotte about your amazing house in Telluride.,
334,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Sounds wonderful.,
335,2.0,6.0,Lydia,I'm gonna get us some drinks.,
336,2.0,6.0,Lydia,- Champagne? ,
337,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,- Sure.,
338,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,Do you ski? ,
339,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,"Yes, but not well. I guess I'm what you'd call a snow bunny.",
340,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,I just kind of hop down the bunny trail.,
341,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,"It's not a prerequisite, believe me.",
342,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,It's wonderful to leave the city and be in the mountains.,
343,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Absolutely.,
344,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,You should plan to join us the next time.,
345,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,I know Lydia would love it if you could.,
346,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,That's very generous of you.,
347,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,"But before we get on a plane together, there's something we all want to know.",
348,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,Are you gay? ,
349,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,"No, I'm not. But I do so enjoy the company of all these women.",
350,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,Everyone's so smart and funny.,
351,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,"After spending too much time and attention on men it feels like such a safe, warm environment.",
352,2.0,6.0,Charlotte,"And while sexually, I feel that I am straight there's a very powerful part of me that connects to the female spirit.",
353,2.0,6.0,Patty Aston,"Sweetheart, that's all very nice but if you're not going to eat pussy, you're not a dyke.",
354,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"Later that afternoon, following a particularly grueling workout with Thor Samantha decided to take a relaxing steam.",
355,2.0,6.0,Woman in Steam Room,That asshole! ,
356,2.0,6.0,Carrie,That day at the gym Samantha discovered that lightning does indeed strike twice.,
357,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"That evening, Miranda was treated to a double bill.",
358,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Nanook of the North at Alice Tully Hall and Steady as She Blows at Ethan Watson's Porn Palace.,
359,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,Hold it right there.,
360,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"All right, that's enough! This is not a synchronized event.",
361,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"Look, I like you.",
362,2.0,6.0,Miranda,But this is ridiculous.,
363,2.0,6.0,Miranda,It's either the women in the video or me.,
364,2.0,6.0,Miranda,"Your choice, but you can't have both.",
365,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,It's not that simple.,
366,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,I've only known you for a few weeks.,
367,2.0,6.0,Ethan Watson,But I've been involved with these women for years.,
368,2.0,6.0,Miranda,I am so out of here.,
369,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"That night, for the first time ever, Big took me out dancing.",
370,2.0,6.0,Carrie,It was like he knew I needed to talk to him and decided to make it as difficult as possible.,
371,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"Our attraction, or addiction, or whatever, was strong.",
372,2.0,6.0,Carrie,But I knew I had to be stronger.,
373,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Does this mean we're seeing each other again? Officially? ,
374,2.0,6.0,Big,If you say so.,
375,2.0,6.0,Carrie,That is an infuriating response.,
376,2.0,6.0,Big,"I don't know what ""officially"" means.",
377,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"""Officially"" means officially.",
378,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"You know, for real.",
379,2.0,6.0,Big,"Every moment of my life is for real, baby.",
380,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Just answer me this: Why did we break up? ,
381,2.0,6.0,Big,You tell me. You're the one who left me high and dry with two tickets to St.,
382,2.0,6.0,Big,Barts.,
383,2.0,6.0,Carrie,You didn't say what I wanted to hear.,
384,2.0,6.0,Big,"Is that it? No, not just that.",
385,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I wanted to tell him I was afraid he could never love me the way I wanted to be loved.,
386,2.0,6.0,Carrie,I was afraid that he didn't really have the capacity to love anyone but himself.,
387,2.0,6.0,Carrie,"I was afraid that, given the chance, he'd break my heart again.",
388,2.0,6.0,Carrie,But I cheated and just said I guess I was afraid.,
389,2.0,6.0,Big,I can tell you one thing.,
390,2.0,6.0,Big,I sure did miss you officially.,
391,2.0,6.0,Carrie,Did you cry? ,
392,2.0,6.0,Big,No. But I did listen to a hell of a lot of Sinatra.,

234,2.0,8.0,Samantha,"Why, Ed.",
235,2.0,8.0,Samantha,That's not Viagra.,
236,2.0,8.0,Carrie,Samantha was suddenly living her own urban relationship myth.,
237,2.0,8.0,Carrie,The woman who stopped for a cocktail after work and lived happily ever after.,
238,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"For 10 to 12 years, tops.",
239,2.0,8.0,Samantha,I think in the dark is sexier.,
240,2.0,8.0,Samantha,Could you get that light behind you? ,
241,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"In the dark, she learned that all cats not only look the same but felt the same. Ed's lips were not the lips of an older man.",
242,2.0,8.0,Carrie,Ed's touch was not the touch of an older man.,
243,2.0,8.0,Ed,"Excuse me, baby.",
244,2.0,8.0,Ed,Little boy's room.,
245,2.0,8.0,Carrie,Unfortunately Ed's ass was the ass of an older man.,
246,2.0,8.0,Carrie,She told him it was a bad reaction to the shellfish from dinner.,
247,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"Saturday afternoon, Miranda was at home enjoying a cup of coffee and her New York Times when fate came knocking.",
248,2.0,8.0,Miranda,Yes? ,
249,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,It's Steve.,
250,2.0,8.0,Miranda,Steve who? ,
251,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,"Steve Brady, the bartender.",
252,2.0,8.0,Miranda,What do you want? ,
253,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,-You want your neighbors to hear? Hi. Thanks for letting me in.,
254,2.0,8.0,Miranda,- Did you forget something? ,
255,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,"No, I didn't have your number and I wanted to tell you something. I like you.",
256,2.0,8.0,Miranda,"Translation: ""I think you're an easy lay and I'd like to have sex again.",
257,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,""" It's not like that.",
258,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,Have dinner with me.,
259,2.0,8.0,Miranda,Why? ,
260,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,"I don't know, because we're hungry.",
261,2.0,8.0,Miranda,I can't have dinner with you.,
262,2.0,8.0,Miranda,I don't even know you.,
263,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,- You slept with me.,
264,2.0,8.0,Miranda,- It's a different thing.,
265,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,- How 'bout tonight? ,
266,2.0,8.0,Miranda,- I have plans.,
267,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,- You don't have plans.,
268,2.0,8.0,Miranda,- I do.,
269,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,"What plans? Quick, before you make one up.",
270,2.0,8.0,Miranda,I'm meeting my friends downtown at Denial for dinner.,
271,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,My buddy works there.,
272,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,I'll meet you for a drink. What time?,
273,2.0,8.0,Miranda, 7 .,
274,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,Okay. What time are you really meeting them? ,
275,2.0,8.0,Miranda,9,
276,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"At 8:15, I arrived at Big's.",
277,2.0,8.0,Carrie,One quick drink and we'd be out the door.,
278,2.0,8.0,Carrie,I told myself all day it was just another dinner with friends.,
279,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"But, as I stood waiting, in my new, very favorite dress I realized it meant a lot more.",
280,2.0,8.0,Big,"Hi, baby, c'mon in.",
281,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"You're not properly attired to meet my friends, mister.",
282,2.0,8.0,Carrie,Hop to it.,
283,2.0,8.0,Big,"About that Do you mind if I don't go? I've been out all day, it's gonna rain.",
284,2.0,8.0,Carrie,But my friends are expecting you.,
285,2.0,8.0,Big,"I know, but they're your friends and they'll be fine with just you.",
286,2.0,8.0,Big,Is it okay? ,
287,2.0,8.0,Carrie,Sure. I was afraid if I looked up into his eyes I'd turn to stone.,
288,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"How could I have let myself believe things would be different the second time around? I'd never heard of a myth in which a self-centered, 42-year-old baby magically transformed into a grown man that you could bring out in public.",
289,2.0,8.0,Charlotte,They won't seat us 'til all of our party is here.,
290,2.0,8.0,Charlotte,How long do you think Big will be?,
291,2.0,8.0,Carrie," I'm not sure, he's coming from work. I didn't have the strength to tell them about my fallen hero.",
292,2.0,8.0,Carrie,Not without a cocktail.,
293,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"I figured as long as I was ""in Denial,"" I might as well stay there.",
294,2.0,8.0,Samantha,Look at you.,
295,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,"If you want good service, send a bartender.",
296,2.0,8.0,Miranda,"If you want a good fuck, go home with one.",
297,2.0,8.0,Miranda,Hello! It was funny!  ,
298,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,"Miranda Can I talk to you over there, for a second?",
299,2.0,8.0,Miranda,The gods are punishing me for having casual sex.,
300,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,Thank you.,
301,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,One quick question and I'm out of here.,
302,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,Why do you hate guys so much? ,
303,2.0,8.0,Miranda,Excuse me?,
304,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,"We just met, so I know that it ain't all about me.",
305,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,Wait.,
306,2.0,8.0,Miranda,What do you want?,
307,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady, I just wanna get to know you better. Do me a favor.,
308,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,"Can you, for a second, believe that maybe I'm not some ""full-of-shit"" guy? That maybe I do like you? That maybe the other night was special? - Do you think maybe you can believe that? ",
309,2.0,8.0,Miranda,- No. Maybe I've just slept with too many bartenders.,
310,2.0,8.0,Samantha,Are you okay? ,
311,2.0,8.0,Miranda,I don't wanna talk about it.,
312,2.0,8.0,Steve Brady,"Nice meeting you all, excuse me.",
313,2.0,8.0,Carrie,- Maybe we should get a table for four.,
314,2.0,8.0,Miranda,- I knew it.,
315,2.0,8.0,Miranda,Big's not coming.,
316,2.0,8.0,Miranda,Men are shit.,
317,2.0,8.0,Charlotte,"What are you talking about? He's coming, isn't he? ",
318,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"I didn't know if I had the heart to tell Charlotte that ""happily ever after"" really was just a myth. ",
319,2.0,8.0,Charlotte,"See, there he is!",
320,2.0,8.0,Big,It's really coming down out there.,
321,2.0,8.0,Carrie,- You remember my friends? ,
322,2.0,8.0,Big,"- Of course, I do. Hello, ladies.",
323,2.0,8.0,Carrie,Seeing Big show up for me shook Miranda's lack of belief system to the very core.,
324,2.0,8.0,Miranda,Excuse me.,
325,2.0,8.0,Big,More drinks? ,
326,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"Just like that, Miranda left Denial.",
327,2.0,8.0,Miranda,Steve! Maybe I can believe it.,
328,2.0,8.0,Carrie,"From that night on, promiscuous women everywhere would tell the tale of the one-night stand that turned into a relationship.",
329,2.0,8.0,Carrie,As for Big and me ,
330,2.0,8.0,Big,"So, Samantha tell me. Did you ever get it on with that old coot? ",
331,2.0,8.0,Carrie,That was the night we stopped being a myth and started becoming real.,
0,2.0,9.0,Carrie,They say that the women in New York are the most beautiful women in the world.,
1,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Which explains why men in New York spend all their time looking at them.,
2,2.0,9.0,Carrie,The city is a veritable playground for men's roving eyes.,
3,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, they need both of them looking straight ahead to survive.",
4,2.0,9.0,Carrie,This New York woman was pretty happy. I was seeing Big again.,
5,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, my New York guy was still seeing other women.",
6,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"If checking out other women is the biggest problem you are having with him, you're lucky.",
7,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"-If it's so small, he should be able to stop. ",
8,2.0,9.0,Samantha,-You can't change that about a man.,
9,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"It's part of their genetic code, like farting.",
10,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-You're gonna put me off my pretzel. ,
11,2.0,9.0,Samantha,-You have to take Big the way he is.,
12,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"Once you try to change a man, it's doomed. They won't budge an inch.",
13,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"I know, but you can subtly manipulate and cajole.",
14,2.0,9.0,Samantha,The only things you can work on are their hair and wardrobe.,
15,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"-But even then, it's a constant battle.",
16,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-I already like the hair and wardrobe.,
17,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"Then be happy. Honey, no man is perfect.",
18,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"I'm not asking for perfection, I'm just looking for slight alterations.",
19,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"Be careful with alterations. If you pull the wrong thread, everything falls apart.",
20,2.0,9.0,Carrie,While Samantha and I discussed the theory of change...,
21,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...Miranda was going through it for real.,
22,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"She had a new apartment, a new boyfriend...",
23,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...and a new dating schedule that was killing her.,
24,2.0,9.0,Steve,Hey. I'm sorry. I thought we'd be closing the bar earlier.,x
25,2.0,9.0,Steve,-You were asleep. ,
26,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"-No, I'm up. Hi. Come on in.",
27,2.0,9.0,Steve,Come here. You okay? Let's see.,
28,2.0,9.0,Steve,-Is that better? ,
29,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-That's better. Thank you.,
30,2.0,9.0,Steve,How was your night?,
31,2.0,9.0,Miranda,I don't know. I was asleep.,
32,2.0,9.0,Steve,I'm sorry I was late.,
33,2.0,9.0,Steve,We were gonna close the bar at 2:00.,
34,2.0,9.0,Steve,Then we got this big group of Japanese bankers came in.,
35,2.0,9.0,Steve,And all they want is these big flaming drinks.,
36,2.0,9.0,Steve,Then one of them got sick and....Never mind.,
37,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Everything was great about Steve except for one thing.,
38,2.0,9.0,Steve,-Morning. ,
39,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-Morning.,
40,2.0,9.0,Steve,Come here.,
41,2.0,9.0,Carrie,They had completely opposite schedules.,
42,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Steve had all the time in the world in the morning.,
43,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Miranda got right up at 7:00. Unfortunately, Steve did, too.",
44,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-I have to go to work. ,
45,2.0,9.0,Steve,Not yet.,
46,2.0,9.0,Carrie,The only thing she liked inside her in the morning...,
47,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...was the cup of take-out coffee she drank on the way to the subway.,
48,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"That night, in a bed across town...",
49,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"...Charlotte was seeing a lot of Mike, a cute, but feared restaurant critic...",
50,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...famous for his patented five-whisk rating system.,
51,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,-Mike?  ,
52,2.0,9.0,Mike,-Yeah?,
53,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,Let's make love.,
54,2.0,9.0,Mike,You are a five-whisk woman.,
55,2.0,9.0,Carrie,But just when Charlotte had become comfortable with the penis...,
56,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...she got a very unexpected surprise.,
57,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,You're....It's....,
58,2.0,9.0,Mike,Uncircumcised. Is that okay?,
59,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,No. Sure. Of course it is.,
60,2.0,9.0,Carrie,It was not okay. The only uncut version of anything Charlotte had ever seen...,
61,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...was the original Gone with the Wind.,
62,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,"There was so much skin, it was like a Shar-Pei!",
63,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-You've never seen an uncircumcised one? ,
64,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,-I'm from Connecticut!,
65,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"Reminder: you're dating the guy, not the penis.",
66,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,Aesthetics are important to me.,
67,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"It's not what it looks like, it's what they can do with it.",
68,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,I don't need one that can make its own carrying case!,
69,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"Personally, I love an uncircumcised dick.",
70,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"It's like a Tootsie Pop. Hard on the outside, with a delicious surprise inside.",
71,2.0,9.0,Miranda,I don't like surprises. I like it all out there where I can see it.,
72,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,"Same here. I'm sorry, it is not normal.",
73,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Actually, it is. Something like 85% men aren't circumcised.",
74,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,"-Great, now they're taking over the world!  ",
75,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"-It's a penis, not Godzilla.",
76,2.0,9.0,Miranda,If 85% aren't circumcised...,
77,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"...that means I've only slept with 15% of the population, tops.",
78,2.0,9.0,Carrie,You're practically a virgin.,
79,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,"You know, he's a nice, waspy guy. What went wrong?",
80,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Maybe his parents were hippies and didn't believe in it.,
81,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-I am so circumcising my kids. ,
82,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-I think you can pay people to do that now.,
83,2.0,9.0,Miranda,I don't ever wanna know there's a woman out there calling my son a Shar-Pei.,
84,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"All I'm saying is, uncut men are the best. They try harder.",
85,2.0,9.0,Samantha,I should know. I've slept with five of them.,
86,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,-Out of how many? ,
87,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-Infinity.,
88,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"That night, Big and I went out to celebrate absolutely nothing.",
89,2.0,9.0,Big,-More grappa?  ,
90,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"-No, thank ya.",
91,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Listen, my editor called me today and she's....",
92,2.0,9.0,Big,-You were saying?  ,
93,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"-Yes, I was.",
94,2.0,9.0,Hostess,Excuse me; you can't smoke that in here.,
95,2.0,9.0,Big,"Really? You're absolutely, positively sure about that?",
96,2.0,9.0,Big,Because I checked the zoning on this particular table...,
97,2.0,9.0,Big,...and I'm pretty sure this table is in a cigar-friendly zone.,
98,2.0,9.0,Hostess,"I don't mind, but it's for the other patrons.",
99,2.0,9.0,Big,"You mean if those five patrons don't mind, it's okay with you?",
100,2.0,9.0,Hostess,"-Sir, I'm gonna have to-",
101,2.0,9.0,Big,- -Just one second.,
102,2.0,9.0,Big,Excuse me; this is my last day on earth.,
103,2.0,9.0,Big,I'm being executed tomorrow morning. That's my parole officer there.,
104,2.0,9.0,Big,"Would you mind terribly if I smoked this, ladies?",
105,2.0,9.0,Big,Thank you.,
106,2.0,9.0,Big,"Excuse me, I'm sorry. Would it be okay if I smoked this?",
107,2.0,9.0,Big,"Please, let me preface this by saying: I'd like to buy everybody a round of drinks.",
108,2.0,9.0,Big,"Apparently, the other patrons aren't bothered at all.",
109,2.0,9.0,Carrie,I didn't have the guts to tell Big that he was actually kind of bothering me.,
110,2.0,9.0,Carrie,They won't tell you the truth.,
111,2.0,9.0,Carrie,No one is gonna say to your face they hate your cigar.,
112,2.0,9.0,Big,Good.,
113,2.0,9.0,Carrie,You are very arrogant.,
114,2.0,9.0,Big,I thought that's what you liked about me.,
115,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Maybe Big was right.,
116,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Maybe we were at that inevitable point in the relationship...,
117,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...when all those little things you loved about the other person become huge liabilities.,
118,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"And just then, a huge liability walked by.",
119,2.0,9.0,Big,What?,
120,2.0,9.0,Carrie,I hate that cigar.,
121,2.0,9.0,Big,And you told me right to my face.,
122,2.0,9.0,Carrie,New York City is all about change.,
123,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"New Yorkers change their haircuts, their politics, even their friends in the blink of an eye.",
124,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"If change was so easy, why was it so hard for Big?",
125,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Was I banging my head against the wall, thinking I can get him to stop and notice me?",
126,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Did I have to change my expectations or was it possible...Can you change a man?,
127,2.0,9.0,Woman,My husband used to be obsessed with watching sports 24 hours a day.,
128,2.0,9.0,Woman,Then I started fooling around with his best friend.,
129,2.0,9.0,Woman,And now he's obsessed with watching me.,
130,2.0,9.0,Man,Every girlfriend I've had wants me to change something.,
131,2.0,9.0,Man,"Change your job, change your friends, change your attitude.",
132,2.0,9.0,Man,The only thing I ever change is girlfriends.,
133,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Charlotte was about to discover that some men can change.",
134,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,Thanks for dinner. It was great.,
135,2.0,9.0,Mike,Can I come upstairs with you?,
136,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,"I have to get up really early, and my place is just a mess.",
137,2.0,9.0,Mike,"Look, I understand.",
138,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,-You do?  ,
139,2.0,9.0,Mike,"-Yeah, what happened the other night.",
140,2.0,9.0,Mike,You're not the first woman to react to it that way. I've gotten it most of my life.,
141,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,Really?,
142,2.0,9.0,Mike,"Yeah, and I've decided to do something about it.",
143,2.0,9.0,Mike,"I've been uncomfortable for too long, so I'm getting circumcised.",
144,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,Can you do that?,
145,2.0,9.0,Mike,"Yeah. I mean, it hurts. It takes a long time to heal.",
146,2.0,9.0,Mike,But I'm willing to do that. I want to feel good about making love.,
147,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,That is so sweet.,
148,2.0,9.0,Mike,-Do you mind waiting? ,
149,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,"-No, not at all.",
150,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Apparently, Samantha was wrong. Some men could budge an inch.",
151,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"In Mike's case, it may have been more like an inch and a half.",
152,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"The next morning, Miranda was getting her usual wake-up call.",
153,2.0,9.0,Steve,Where you going?,
154,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-I'm getting up.,
155,2.0,9.0,Steve,"-Come on, it's Saturday.",
156,2.0,9.0,Steve,"Come on, lay down, slow down. Come here.",
157,2.0,9.0,Miranda,How long are we gonna do this?,
158,2.0,9.0,Steve,-You want a time frame for cuddling?,
159,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-Yeah. Like 20 minutes? 30?,
160,2.0,9.0,Steve,You're kidding me.,
161,2.0,9.0,Miranda,It helps if I have an end point in mind. I respond well to limits.,
162,2.0,9.0,Steve,"That's your problem, you got too many limits. You gotta let go a little.",
163,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"Look. Saturday is my free day, right? I have spinning and then I get my dry cleaning.",
164,2.0,9.0,Miranda,Then I get my nails done and I do my grocery shopping for the week.,
165,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-Okay? ,
166,2.0,9.0,Steve,-You're not sounding very free to me.,
167,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"Do you want to come with me and get my dry cleaning? No, I didn't think so.",
168,2.0,9.0,Steve,"An hour and a half, tops.",
169,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Twelve hours later, Steve went to work.",
170,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"About the same time, we went out to our favorite bar...",
171,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...which on Saturdays changes into drag queen bingo.,
172,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"Come on, N-23.",
173,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"I really like him, but this morning thing is killing me.",
174,2.0,9.0,Miranda,It’s bad enough we've never done it at night.,
175,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"After we do it in the morning, he just wants to lie there with me.",
176,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,Everyone wants a guy who wants to cuddle.,
177,2.0,9.0,Bingo caller,"O-33, Ladies.",
178,2.0,9.0,Samantha,Shit!,
179,2.0,9.0,Carrie,I'm jealous. Big won't even spend the night at my place.,
180,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-What you have is real intimacy.,
181,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-It's bed arrest.,
182,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"I've been horizontal all day, and I had errands to do. I missed spinning.",
183,2.0,9.0,Carrie,You don't have to spin if you're having sex.,
184,2.0,9.0,Bingo caller,B-12!,
185,2.0,9.0,Samantha,-How about N-23? ,
186,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,"-I don't know why I play this, I never win.",
187,2.0,9.0,Miranda,Why do I have to be the one to change my routine?,
188,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,Maybe because you really like the guy. It wouldn't kill you to slow down a little.,
189,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Miranda's right.,
190,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Why is it the woman who always has to change and never the guy?,
191,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,-Because we are more adaptable.,
192,2.0,9.0,Samantha,-I love morning sex.,
193,2.0,9.0,Miranda,I haven't done morning sex since I was in college when I didn't have class till 11:00.,
194,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,Maybe you guys should come up with a schedule or something.,
195,2.0,9.0,Miranda,A sex schedule? Very romantic!,
196,2.0,9.0,Samantha,Surprise him at the bar wearing nothing but a trench coat and a smile.,
197,2.0,9.0,Carrie,That would be a happy hour.,
198,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,I think that if you really believe in the relationship you should work at it.,
199,2.0,9.0,Miranda,This from a woman who dumped a guy over foreskin.,
200,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,"Actually, we're still dating.",
201,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-The Shar-Pei?  ,
202,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,-He's getting circumcised.,
203,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Please tell me that we're not invited to the Briss.,
204,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"Can I get another board, please?",
205,2.0,9.0,Brad,-Samantha?,
206,2.0,9.0,Samantha,-Yes.,
207,2.0,9.0,Brad,"It's me, Brad.",
208,2.0,9.0,Samantha,Brad McColskey?,
209,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Brad was a semi-professional hockey player...,x
210,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...Samantha had dated a few years back.,
211,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Apparently the only thing he was checking these days were his pants at the door.,
212,2.0,9.0,Brad,"Look at you, Miss Thing. You look fabulous.",
213,2.0,9.0,Samantha,So do you.,
214,2.0,9.0,Samantha,-When did you start doing.... ,
215,2.0,9.0,Brad,"-About five years ago, right after you.",
216,2.0,9.0,Samantha,"Maybe Samantha was wrong. Apparently, she could change a man.",
217,2.0,9.0,Samantha,-How are the kids?  ,
218,2.0,9.0,Brad,-Good. Jake is in second grade. ,

224,2.0,9.0,Bingo caller,N-23.,

226,2.0,9.0,Samantha,I am so much prettier than him.,
227,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Two hours later, I was supposed to meet Big at his place.",
228,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Two and a half hours later, he showed up.",
229,2.0,9.0,Big,Sorry.,
230,2.0,9.0,Carrie,You're a half hour late. Your doorman thinks I'm a hooker.,
231,2.0,9.0,Big,-Did you make any money?,
232,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-Not funny. I hate waiting here for you.,
233,2.0,9.0,Big,There's a coffee shop around the corner you could have waited in.,
234,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-You know what? I'm gonna go. ,
235,2.0,9.0,Big,-Don't be pissed.,
236,2.0,9.0,Carrie,I'm pissed.,
237,2.0,9.0,Big,Come upstairs.,
238,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"You know, if you gave me a key, I could wait upstairs next time.",
239,2.0,9.0,Big,A key?,
240,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Or you can stay at my place sometimes. It's easy to pick my locks.,
241,2.0,9.0,Big,"Yeah, but then I like my bed.",
242,2.0,9.0,Big,Look at that service. Come on.,
243,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"That night, something else changed. Neither of us wanted to make love.",
244,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"If this was all I was ever gonna get out of Big, was it enough for me?",
245,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Then at 3:00 a.m., somewhere between sleep and waking...",
246,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...I got my answer.,
247,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-Damn it! ,
248,2.0,9.0,Big,-What?,
249,2.0,9.0,Big,-Are you all right? ,
250,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-No!,
251,2.0,9.0,Big,-What the fuck?,
252,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-My God!,
253,2.0,9.0,Big,-What the hell was that? ,
254,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-You knocked me out of bed!,
255,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-You didn't even know I was here! ,
256,2.0,9.0,Big,-I do now. Why don't you break my arm the next time?,
257,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-I'm sorry.,
258,2.0,9.0,Big,-Jesus!,

261,2.0,9.0,Big,-To sleep on the couch.,
262,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"-Wait, would you just let me explain?",
263,2.0,9.0,Big,-Don't talk now. Bad to talk now.,
264,2.0,9.0,Carrie,But I couldn't sleep.,
265,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"And at 4:00 a.m., I decided he couldn't sleep either.",
266,2.0,9.0,Carrie,It's ice for your face.,
267,2.0,9.0,Big,"Yes, I can feel that.",
268,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Okay, I know I've lost a little of my power here.",
269,2.0,9.0,Carrie,I'm pretty sure that most women's magazines...,
270,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...would say that what I just did was a very bad idea.,
271,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"But the thing is, the other night wasn't just about the cigar.",
272,2.0,9.0,Big,It never is.,
273,2.0,9.0,Carrie,I hate that you look at other women.,
274,2.0,9.0,Carrie,I hate that I don't have a key to your place. You've never spent the night at my place.,
275,2.0,9.0,Carrie,You can't even make space for me in your bed.,
276,2.0,9.0,Carrie,And it's not your fault because I never say it.,
277,2.0,9.0,Carrie,So now I punched you. So now I have to say it.,
278,2.0,9.0,Carrie,So now I'm gonna say it.,
279,2.0,9.0,Carrie,I feel like I'm back in your life and nothing has really changed.,
280,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"I know you can't change a man, and you definitely can't change a man like you.",
281,2.0,9.0,Carrie,But...I still want...something to change a little bit...for me.,
282,2.0,9.0,Big,Physical violence is never the answer.,
283,2.0,9.0,Carrie,I'm gonna go.,
284,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-Does it hurt? ,
285,2.0,9.0,Big,-Yes.,
286,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Look, I'm sure there are things you don't like about me.",
287,2.0,9.0,Big,I'm not falling for that one.,
288,2.0,9.0,Carrie,That was one thing I liked about Big. He definitely knew when to shut up.,
289,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"The next night, Charlotte took Mike out for a post-operative scotch.",
290,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,Did it hurt?,
291,2.0,9.0,Mike,"On a scale of one to five, I'd give it a 72.",
292,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,-You poor thing. ,
293,2.0,9.0,Mike,-That's all right.,
294,2.0,9.0,Mike,The worst is over. Now I just accept sympathy and heal.,
295,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,-For how long? ,
296,2.0,9.0,Mike,-About another week or so.,
297,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,-I can't wait.,
298,2.0,9.0,Mike,"-Me either. God, you really turn me on.",
299,2.0,9.0,Mike,You should go.,
300,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Much later that night, bolstered by coffee...",
301,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...Miranda decided to perform a 2:00 a.m. seduction.,
302,2.0,9.0,Miranda,Hello.,
303,2.0,9.0,Steve,Look at you! You look great. What's the occasion?,
304,2.0,9.0,Miranda,It's 2:00 a.m. and I am still awake.,
305,2.0,9.0,Miranda,I thought we could celebrate. I've had five cups of coffee.,
306,2.0,9.0,Steve,That's worth a party.,
307,2.0,9.0,Miranda,Meet me in the bedroom. I'll get the wine.,
308,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-Get up. ,
309,2.0,9.0,Steve,-What? ,
310,2.0,9.0,Miranda,I think you should spend the night at your place tonight.,
311,2.0,9.0,Steve,-Why?,
312,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-Because I'd really like to catch up on my sleep.,
313,2.0,9.0,Miranda,I really don't want to worry about having sex with you in the morning...,
314,2.0,9.0,Miranda,...and then just Iying there and being late.,
315,2.0,9.0,Steve,-You don't like having sex with me.  ,
316,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"-No, I do. I love it.",
317,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"But just once I would like to do it at night, like other normal Homo sapiens.",
318,2.0,9.0,Steve,"-Relax, we can have sex now. ",
319,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-We can't have sex now!,
320,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"I had a window, and it happened half an hour ago!",
321,2.0,9.0,Steve,-You had a window for sex?,
322,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"-I'm sorry, I'm a lawyer. I get tired.",
323,2.0,9.0,Steve,I'm a bartender and I get awfully tired of dealing with other people's neuroses.,
324,2.0,9.0,Steve,"When you get, you know...a picture window, or a whole doorway of time...call me.",
325,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Miranda had never felt less like a successful lawyer in her life.,
326,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Even though she'd won her case, she'd also been left with all the damages.",
327,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"A week later, Charlotte finally got her chance to break in the new merchandise.",
328,2.0,9.0,Mike,What do you think?,
329,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,It's perfect.,
330,2.0,9.0,Carrie,It was like her birthday and Christmas rolled into one.,
331,2.0,9.0,Mike,You realize this makes me a virgin.,
332,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,I'll be gentle.,
333,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,That was really wonderful.,
334,2.0,9.0,Mike,It was. A five.,
335,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,So what do you want to do Saturday night?,
336,2.0,9.0,Mike,Saturday? Did we have plans?,
337,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,"No, but I thought maybe we could go to this drama league benefit...",
338,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,"...or we could, you know, go low-key and stay in and rent videos.",
339,2.0,9.0,Mike,"Hang on, listen.",
340,2.0,9.0,Mike,"I don't think I'm ready for this to be, you know, like a big thing.",
341,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,A big thing?,
342,2.0,9.0,Mike,I just feel like I can't be tied down right now.,
343,2.0,9.0,Mike,There's a whole new me happening. I should get out there and share it.,
344,2.0,9.0,Charlotte,You want to share your penis?,
345,2.0,9.0,Mike,Well...yeah.,
346,2.0,9.0,Mike,I mean I feel like I owe it to myself to take the doggie out for a walk around the block...you know?,
347,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Charlotte never saw Mike again.,
348,2.0,9.0,Carrie,She realized you can take the Shar-Pei out of the penis...,
349,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...but you could never take the dog out of the man.,
350,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"A few days later, I realized you could change a man.",
351,2.0,9.0,Carrie,You could change him into not calling you.,
352,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Hi. Look at that.,
353,2.0,9.0,Big,"No, you look at it. I've seen it already.",
354,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Sorry.,
355,2.0,9.0,Big,"Easy, no hands near the face.",
356,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Come in.,
357,2.0,9.0,Big,I just came over to tell you something.,
358,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"You're suing me, right?",
359,2.0,9.0,Big,"Look, maybe you need a key to know that I'm crazy about you.",
360,2.0,9.0,Big,"But the thing is, I've given out, like, five keys...",
361,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...and you never get’em back.,
362,2.0,9.0,Big,And maybe I hog my bed. But I mean it's my bed and I like you in it.,
363,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-I should hit you more often.,
364,2.0,9.0,Big,-And the oranges.,
365,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-What?  ,
366,2.0,9.0,Big,-The oranges have to go. This is something I don't like about you.,
367,2.0,9.0,Big,-I hate that you eat oranges in my bed.,
368,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-You do?,
369,2.0,9.0,Big,They're sticky and they make the sheets stink.,
370,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-That's it?  ,
371,2.0,9.0,Big,-I like my sheets.,
372,2.0,9.0,Carrie,What are you gonna give me for the oranges?,
373,2.0,9.0,Big,-A negotiation? ,
374,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-Yep.,
375,2.0,9.0,Big,-This could take a while.,
376,2.0,9.0,Carrie,-It could.,
377,2.0,9.0,Big,It looks like I may have to spend the night.,
378,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"That night, for the first time, Big spent the night at my place.",
379,2.0,9.0,Carrie,I realized that neither of us would ever fundamentally change...,
380,2.0,9.0,Carrie,...but we were talking about it.,
381,2.0,9.0,Carrie,And maybe that was the biggest change of all.,
382,2.0,9.0,Big,The next day my sheets stunk of cigars. I changed them immediately.,
383,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"Across town, it was 2:00 a.m. and Miranda was no closer to getting sleep.",
384,2.0,9.0,Miranda,-Hello. ,
385,2.0,9.0,Steve,-Hey!,
386,2.0,9.0,Miranda,Hi.,
387,2.0,9.0,Steve,Sorry to wake you.,
388,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"It's okay, I was awake.",
389,2.0,9.0,Steve,"Look, I don't wanna bug you. Do me a favor. Go to the window.",
390,2.0,9.0,Miranda,Okay.,
391,2.0,9.0,Steve,Now look up.,
392,2.0,9.0,Miranda,Oh my God.,
393,2.0,9.0,Steve,"It's amazing, isn’t it? It's a blue moon. It's really rare. I just wanted you to see it.",
394,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"It was right then, that Miranda finally slowed down and gave into Steve.",
395,2.0,9.0,Miranda,"Come over when you're done, okay?",
396,2.0,9.0,Steve,Yeah.,
397,2.0,9.0,Miranda,Night.,
398,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"That night, Miranda and Steve made love.",
399,2.0,9.0,Carrie,And they did it again in the morning.,
400,2.0,9.0,Carrie,Miranda was an hour late for work and didn't even notice.,
401,2.0,9.0,Carrie,So maybe you can't change a man...,
402,2.0,9.0,Carrie,"...but once in a blue moon, you can change a woman.",
0,2.0,10.0,Carrie,"Here are some things I love about New York: That week in spring when it's warm, but not hot and the trees are just beginning to bloom.",
1,2.0,10.0,Carrie,Men in suits.,
2,2.0,10.0,Carrie,Three papers and 12 gossip columns.,
3,2.0,10.0,Carrie,"It's easy for me to say, ""I love you, New York.",

8,2.0,10.0,Big,"Thanks, honey.",
9,2.0,10.0,Big,What? ,
10,2.0,10.0,Carrie,Nothing. The first time I felt like saying it was the night he took me to the ballet.,
11,2.0,10.0,Carrie,And he hates the ballet.,
12,2.0,10.0,Big,I don't want to disappoint you.,
13,2.0,10.0,Big,A couple of those dancers were on wires.,
14,2.0,10.0,Carrie,They were not.,
15,2.0,10.0,Big,On a couple of those big leaps I saw the wires.,
16,2.0,10.0,Carrie,You know what? What? I love your hair like that.,
17,2.0,10.0,Big,Cut it out.,
18,2.0,10.0,Carrie,And then there was the time I never expected to say it.,
19,2.0,10.0,Carrie,Last Friday night at approximately 7:20 p.,
20,2.0,10.0,Carrie,M Big was picking me up to take me out to dinner.,
21,2.0,10.0,Carrie,I just have to change my shoes.,

26,2.0,10.0,Big,I just saw it and thought of you.,
27,2.0,10.0,Carrie,It was just wrong.,
28,2.0,10.0,Carrie,It was wrong.,
29,2.0,10.0,Carrie,I didn't know what to say except: I love you.,
30,2.0,10.0,Samantha,"You told Big, ""I love you"", because he gave you that? ",
31,2.0,10.0,Miranda,I think my mother has one in the shape of a squirrel.,
32,2.0,10.0,Samantha,"What did you think it was, a large diamond duck ring?",
33,2.0,10.0,Carrie,"Note that I did not say, ""I love the purse.",
34,2.0,10.0,Charlotte,""" What did he say? ",
35,2.0,10.0,Carrie,He just sort of reacted stunned for a moment and then he said: ,
36,2.0,10.0,Big,You're welcome. I'll just wait for you outside.,
37,2.0,10.0,Charlotte,"Maybe he thought you said, ""I love it.",
38,2.0,10.0,Carrie,""" It was a very deliberate and distinct ""you.",

41,2.0,10.0,Carrie,"He has to say ""I love you"" back or I have to break up with him.",
42,2.0,10.0,Charlotte,How long are you giving him?,
43,2.0,10.0,Carrie," I didn't put an expiration date on it. It's got the shelf life of a dairy product, it'll curdle in a week.",
44,2.0,10.0,Samantha,It's so interesting.,
45,2.0,10.0,Samantha,"Tell a man, ""I hate you"", you'll have the best sex of your life.",
46,2.0,10.0,Samantha,"But tell him, ""I love you"", you'll probably never see him again.",
47,2.0,10.0,Carrie,That's very comforting right now.,
48,2.0,10.0,Miranda,Wait a minute.,
49,2.0,10.0,Miranda,Time out.,
50,2.0,10.0,Miranda,Did you ever think that at this very moment the man might be trying to find his way to tell Carrie that he loves her? ,
51,2.0,10.0,Carrie,"It seemed that Miranda, love's greatest skeptic had recently experienced a romantic epiphany.",
52,2.0,10.0,Group,No.,
53,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,Grab us a seat outside and I'll meet you out there.,
54,2.0,10.0,Miranda,- Will you let me pay this time? ,
55,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,- Your money's no good here.,
56,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,Grab us a bench.,
57,2.0,10.0,Miranda,All right.,
58,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,- How much? ,
59,2.0,10.0,Clerk,-5,
60,2.0,10.0,Carrie,She was dating a bartender who worshiped her.,
61,2.0,10.0,Carrie,Miranda was so crazy about him in return she let him take her out to dinner.,
62,2.0,10.0,Carrie,But only to places she knew he could afford.,
63,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,"Best slices in the city, don't you think? ",

66,2.0,10.0,Miranda,"I warn you, it'll be totally boring.",
67,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,It's not gonna be boring if I'm there with you.,
68,2.0,10.0,Miranda,You probably should wear a suit.,
69,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,It's gonna be a big fancy affair.,
70,2.0,10.0,Miranda,"- You do have a suit, right? ",
71,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,"- Sure, I do. It's really nice.",
72,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,It's gold.,
73,2.0,10.0,Miranda,It's gold? ,
74,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,"Yeah, corduroy. What's wrong with corduroy? ",
75,2.0,10.0,Miranda,I don't have enough time to tell you what's wrong with corduroy.,
76,2.0,10.0,Carrie,"For the first time, Steve took Miranda back to his place.",
77,2.0,10.0,Miranda,This is your apartment.,
78,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,You like? ,
79,2.0,10.0,Miranda,It's sweet.,
80,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,I modeled it after DeNiro's place in Taxi Driver.,
81,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,I'm kidding.,
82,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,It's cheap and it's near the bar.,
83,2.0,10.0,Steve Brady,You never have to come here again.,
84,2.0,10.0,Carrie,That evening Miranda experienced her first pangs of yuppie guilt.,
85,2.0,10.0,Charlotte,A lot of wonderful artists worked as bartenders for years.,
86,2.0,10.0,Charlotte,It doesn't mean he won't make money some day.,

14,2.0,11.0,Miranda,My right ovary has given up hope that I will ever get married and have kids.,
15,2.0,11.0,Miranda,It's like a case you know will settle out of court.,
16,2.0,11.0,Miranda,Why bother? ,
17,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- The left one still believes.,
18,2.0,11.0,Miranda,- I'm a biological underachiever.,
19,2.0,11.0,Miranda,It's ironic because that ovary went to Harvard.,
20,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,I have a tilted uterus.,
21,2.0,11.0,Miranda,So.,
22,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,The sperm have to jump over that hurdle to get to my egg.,
23,2.0,11.0,Miranda,"But once they get there, there will be an egg.",
24,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I need a new gynecologist.,
25,2.0,11.0,Samantha,Do you like yours? ,
26,2.0,11.0,Miranda,Not right now. No.,
27,2.0,11.0,Samantha,At least she's a woman.,
28,2.0,11.0,Samantha,"I tried to go to a man, but it was too strange him spending all that time down there and leaving without an orgasm, and a bill.",
29,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Here.,
30,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I'm going to get this.,
31,2.0,11.0,Miranda,I don't think these are accepted here.,
32,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I'm spending the night at Big's.,
33,2.0,11.0,Samantha,"My God After all this time, you don't have so much as a drawer there? ",
34,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Big is weird about stuff.,
35,2.0,11.0,Miranda,All men are.,
36,2.0,11.0,Miranda,That's why you have to just stake out some territory.,
37,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Sweetie - It's not a land run, it's a relationship.",
38,2.0,11.0,Samantha,- Exactly! Talk to him about it! ,
39,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"With Big, I think it's best to walk softly and carry a big purse.",
40,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,"Yes, she shouldn't leave anything there to remain a creature of mystery.",
41,2.0,11.0,Miranda,What's the big mystery? He knows she wears underwear.,
42,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I never leave underwear because I never see it again.,
43,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- What happens to it? ,
44,2.0,11.0,Samantha,- Nothing. I never go back.,
45,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Isn't it a little expensive disposing of lingerie every time you sleep with a guy? ,
46,2.0,11.0,Samantha,That's why I stopped wearing underwear on dates.,
47,2.0,11.0,Miranda,That's why I'm never borrowing a dress from you again.,
48,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,I once found another woman's underwear in a man's bed.,
49,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Maybe it was Samantha's! ,
50,2.0,11.0,Miranda,"Once in Steve's bathroom, I found one of those hair scrunchies from the '80s. I'm not sure what was more disturbing: The fact that he had a girlfriend before or the fact that he dated someone who wore a scrunchie.",
51,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Half my music collection was left behind by past boyfriends.,
52,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- I always give that stuff back.,
53,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- I don't.,
54,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I consider it a parting gift.,
55,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"""Thanks for playing.",
56,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Here's Hootie and the Blowfish.,
57,2.0,11.0,Samantha,""" They're sexual souvenirs.",
58,2.0,11.0,Miranda,"Okay, then I want a T-shirt that says: ""I dated a bartender and all I got was this lousy ovary.",
59,2.0,11.0,Carrie,""" The next morning at Big's, I started to think.",
60,2.0,11.0,Carrie,If the things we leave behind become the archeological relics of our sexual history I should be able to leave something.,
61,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Ancient man left cave drawings to prove they existed.,
62,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I left a Hair Pro 1200.,
63,2.0,11.0,Carrie,And I didn't stop at that.,
64,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Man may have discovered fire but women discovered how to play with it.,
65,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Charlotte was making history as well.,
66,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Tired of the Neanderthals she'd been dating she spent her night with a gay friend who catered parties for the gallery: Dessert chef, Stephan Bodean.",
67,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,I had no idea that Betty Buckley was so talented! ,
68,2.0,11.0,Stephan,Please! She is the cat's pajamas.,
69,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,Why do people say that? ,
70,2.0,11.0,Stephan,I have no idea. Maybe because she was in Cats.,
71,2.0,11.0,Stephan,Let's start another one.,
72,2.0,11.0,Stephan,"Like, ""She's the dog's tuxedo.",
73,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,""" - Thank you so much for inviting me.",
74,2.0,11.0,Stephan,"- No, please.",
75,2.0,11.0,Stephan,Thank you for accepting my last minute invite.,
76,2.0,11.0,Stephan,My friend Don canceled and we had had tickets forever.,
77,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,Call me anytime.,
78,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,It's refreshing to go out with a man I can talk to.,
79,2.0,11.0,Stephan,- You want to grab a cappuccino? ,
80,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,"- No, I've just got to get on home.",
81,2.0,11.0,Stephan,- You're uptown? ,
82,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,"- Yeah, and you're ",
83,2.0,11.0,Stephan,Chelsea. I'll hail you a cab.,
84,2.0,11.0,Stephan,- Or you could get one yourself.,
85,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- It helps to show a little leg.,
86,2.0,11.0,Stephan,"You know, I tried that and nothing.",
87,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,Thank you.,
88,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,Goodnight.,
89,2.0,11.0,Stephan,Goodnight.,
90,2.0,11.0,Carrie,What happened? What do you think?,
91,2.0,11.0,Charlotte, I am so confused. Is he gay or is he straight? ,
92,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"It's not that simple anymore. The real question is: Is he a straight gay man, or is he a gay straight man? The gay straight man was a new strain of heterosexual male spawned in Manhattan as the result of overexposure to fashion exotic cuisine, musical theater and antique furniture.",
93,2.0,11.0,Samantha,"Hopefully, he's a gay straight man meaning he's straight with great gay qualities.",
94,2.0,11.0,Samantha,Whereas a straight gay guy is just a gay guy who plays sports and won't fuck you.,
95,2.0,11.0,Miranda,He must be a gay straight man because he asked Charlotte out for a second date.,
96,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Unless he's a straight gay man in denial.,
97,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,But Saturday night wasn't even a date.,
98,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,I didn't wash my hair and I wore my glasses! ,
99,2.0,11.0,Samantha,"Are those recreational, because this drink isn't doing it for me.",
100,2.0,11.0,Miranda,They're hormones.,
101,2.0,11.0,Miranda,I'm trying to jump-start my ovary.,
102,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- My mother's taking those for menopause.,
103,2.0,11.0,Miranda,"- Does she have a tilted uterus, too? ",
104,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Isn't anybody going to notice my purse?,
105,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,Cute! Is it new?,
106,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"No, but it is quite small and panty-free.",
107,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,You left your underwear at Big's.,
108,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"No, but I did leave a hair brush, a hair dryer, razors tampons and eye-makeup remover.",
109,2.0,11.0,Miranda,Good for you! ,
110,2.0,11.0,Carrie,And something else.,
111,2.0,11.0,Miranda,What?,
112,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"For the first time at Big's, I did a number two.",
113,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,Oh no!,
114,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I think it's a good sign that I feel comfortable enough with Big to do a number two.,
115,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,It is not a good sign! It's the end of romance.,
116,2.0,11.0,Miranda,This is a big deal! I went through a relationship never doing that at the guy's place including a weekend in Bermuda where I spent the whole time running to the lobby.,
117,2.0,11.0,Carrie,It's tough in New York.,
118,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Small apartments, one bathroom.",
119,2.0,11.0,Carrie,You can hear everything.,
120,2.0,11.0,Samantha,That's why I only date rich men.,
121,2.0,11.0,Samantha,Money means that there's enough space to distance yourself from the number two.,
122,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,I have never done a number two at a boyfriend's place.,
123,2.0,11.0,Samantha,"Honey, you're so uptight, you need to do a number seven.",
124,2.0,11.0,Bartender,"Excuse me, it's from that guy at the end of the bar.",
125,2.0,11.0,Samantha,"Really? My God, it's Dominic.",
126,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Dominic Delmonico was a publishing magnate and the first and only man Samantha really loved.,x
127,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"He wined and dined her, set the bar for hot sex then dumped her for an Icelandic supermodel named Anka.",
128,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Once, on the cover of Fortune, he'd fallen to tabloid level due to a messy public divorce.",
129,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I'm just gonna say hello.,
130,2.0,11.0,Miranda,After what he did to you?  ,
131,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- What did he do?,
132,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- He broke her heart.,
133,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Imagining Samantha with a broken heart was more confusing to Charlotte than a French kiss from a gay man.,
134,2.0,11.0,Samantha,Ancient history.,
135,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I'm the one with the power now.,
136,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I've evolved past him.,
137,2.0,11.0,Big,"- Hey, beautiful.",
138,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Hiya, handsome.",
139,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- What's this? ,
140,2.0,11.0,Big,- Just a few things you left at my place.,
141,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Thanks.,
142,2.0,11.0,Carrie,It's like I had one too many items and I was being kicked out of the relationship express lane.,
143,2.0,11.0,Carrie,What is it about Big's apartment? Nothing ever sticks.,
144,2.0,11.0,Carrie,It's like Teflon for women.,
145,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I meant to leave that stuff at your apartment.,
146,2.0,11.0,Big,Why? ,
147,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"For one thing, I don't wake up looking like this. I actually need stuff to look like this and it would be nice not to have to carry it around all day with me like a nomad.",
148,2.0,11.0,Carrie,It's just a few things.,
149,2.0,11.0,Carrie,And you can leave stuff here.,
150,2.0,11.0,Big,- I don't want to leave stuff here.,
151,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- Not a lot of stuff.,
152,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Just like, you know, if you want to shave in the morning.",
153,2.0,11.0,Big,I shave at the gym.,
154,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"I don't know, socks.",
155,2.0,11.0,Big,You want me to leave socks here? ,
156,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Never mind what I want. What do you want? ,
157,2.0,11.0,Big,I don't know. Let's save an hour.,
158,2.0,11.0,Big,Why don't you just tell me what I want? ,
159,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"No, really, in your mind what is the ideal living situation for two people in a relationship?",
160,2.0,11.0,Big,Exactly what we have.,
161,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- And what is that? ,
162,2.0,11.0,Big,"- I have my place, you have yours. We're together when we want to be, we're apart when we want to be.",
163,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- Like Woody and Mia.,
164,2.0,11.0,Big,- Before Soon-Yi.,
165,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Ever since Woody Allen described waving to Mia Farrow across the Park single men in Manhattan had yearned for that kind of separate togetherness.,
166,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I felt like the last dinosaur.,
167,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Was I the one who needed to adapt? Was my view of a relationship extinct? I couldn 't stop thinking about it.,
168,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"This is a city where gay men are so out, they're in where women are so chronically single, ovaries may be the next vestigial organ.",
169,2.0,11.0,Carrie,We can have anything delivered anytime.,
170,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"We can have our dogs walked, our clothes cleaned, our food cooked.",
171,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Who needs a husband when you have a doorman? Are New Yorkers evolving past relationships? ,
172,2.0,11.0,Samantha,"Relationships have declined since women left the cave Iooked around and said, ""This isn't hard.",
173,2.0,11.0,Carrie,""" So you don't need a man, but do you still want one? ",
174,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I want more than one.,
175,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I can't decide whether you represent our future or our demise.,
176,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I am the future! Seeing Dominic reminded me of how needy I was and how far I've come.,
177,2.0,11.0,Samantha,- We're going out Friday night.,
178,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- Sweetie! It took you a year to get over him.,
179,2.0,11.0,Carrie,He treated you like shit.,
180,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- Why do you go out with him again? ,
181,2.0,11.0,Samantha,- Because he treated me like shit.,
182,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- I'm leaning toward demise.,
183,2.0,11.0,Samantha,- It's called revenge.,
184,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I'm gonna make him want me and right before we do it I'm gonna drop him like he dropped me.,
185,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- As long as you've got a plan.,
186,2.0,11.0,Samantha,"- Not only a plan, I have a dress.",
187,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Samantha's revenge fantasy, like all her fantasies, was even better live.",
188,2.0,11.0,Dominic,You're more beautiful than ever.,
189,2.0,11.0,Dominic,So successful and I'm getting gray hair and Anka is taking me for everything I've got.,
190,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I read that she got the sailboat.,
191,2.0,11.0,Dominic,We had good times in that boat.,
192,2.0,11.0,Samantha,- You and Anka? ,
193,2.0,11.0,Dominic,- You and I. Have I mentioned how unbelievable you look in that dress? ,
194,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Since Stephan hadn't come out Charlotte accepted his invitation to stay in.,
195,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,That's delicious.,
196,2.0,11.0,Stephan,Grilled Portobello pizzas topped with fresh basil and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.,
197,2.0,11.0,Stephan,It's Martha's recipe.,
198,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- I love Martha Stewart.,
199,2.0,11.0,Stephan,- She's the dog's tuxedo! ,
200,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,"Look, you have the silk placemats I've been eyeing at Bergdorf's.",
201,2.0,11.0,Stephan,- You have good taste.,
202,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- This is my fantasy kitchen.,
203,2.0,11.0,Stephan,This is my fantasy.,
204,2.0,11.0,Stephan,Is that dress Cynthia Rowley? ,
205,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Charlotte wanted to be open-minded but Stephan seemed to be making it as hard as possible. Meanwhile, Samantha was making Dominic as hard as possible.",
206,2.0,11.0,Samantha,So do you want me?  ,
207,2.0,11.0,Dominic,Do I want you?,
208,2.0,11.0,Carrie,This was the moment Samantha had waited years and years for. What was another couple hours?,
209,2.0,11.0,Samantha, I tried to call you. Were you at Big's? ,
210,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"No, I was out shopping. My relationship is at a standstill, so instead, I'm evolving my look. How did it go with Dominic?",
211,2.0,11.0,Charlotte, I slept with him.,
212,2.0,11.0,Carrie,That wasn't part of the plan.,
213,2.0,11.0,Samantha,It's the new plan.,
214,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I wanted to remind him what he was missing.,
215,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I can't believe I thought he was such a great lover.,
216,2.0,11.0,Samantha,I'm better than him now.,
217,2.0,11.0,Samantha,Bye.,
218,2.0,11.0,Carrie,In order to survive two decades of dating in New York Samantha had become a powerful hybrid: The ego of a man trapped in the body of a woman.,
219,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Charlotte feared the opposite was true of Stephan.,
220,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"She still needed help classifying her find, so she brought in a team of experts.",
221,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,"Carrie, Stanford, this is Stephan.",
222,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- Hi.,
223,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,- Ciao! ,
224,2.0,11.0,Stephan,- You changed your hair.,
225,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- It's just straightened. Have we met? ,
226,2.0,11.0,Stephan,"No, I've seen your column.",
227,2.0,11.0,Stephan,"In that photo, your hair is free flowing and Botticelli-esque.",
228,2.0,11.0,Stephan,It's fabulous either way.,
229,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,"Cannolis and cream puffs and tarts, oh my! ",
230,2.0,11.0,Stephan,I put a little bit of everything. This one's an experiment.,
231,2.0,11.0,Stephan,It's a date tart with pumpkin custard.,
232,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,This is all for us? ,
233,2.0,11.0,Stephan,- Sweets for my sweet.,
234,2.0,11.0,Carrie,- And her freeloading friends.,
235,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,"My nutritionist will kill me, but somebody hand me a fork.",
236,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- Can you join us? ,
237,2.0,11.0,Stephan,- I'd love to. I have got to glaze my wedding cake.,
238,2.0,11.0,Stephan,Get back to me on the tart.,
239,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,I find him very attractive.,
240,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,"Which, of course, means he's straight.",
241,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,He's obviously choosing to be straight because he seems to be head over heels about her.,
242,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,What if he's gay and he doesn't know it yet? ,
243,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,"Honey, we are aware. When I was a boy, my father gave me a book about the female body to teach me about sex.",
244,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,"I took one look at it and said, ""No.",
245,2.0,11.0,Carrie,""" - How is he in bed? ",
246,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- I don't know. I haven't slept with him yet.,
247,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,- Really?,
248,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- But he wants to.,
249,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,It's so not fair.,
250,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,"All the good ones are straight, even the gay ones.",
251,2.0,11.0,Stanford Blatch,Give me a cannoli.,
252,2.0,11.0,Joseph,- Are you looking at my forehead?,
253,2.0,11.0,Miranda,No!,
254,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"- That night, Miranda went out with Joseph Adler a labor-relations lawyer who'd been after her since the firm retreat.",x
255,2.0,11.0,Miranda,The lamb is delicious.,
256,2.0,11.0,Joseph,You can look if you want.,
257,2.0,11.0,Joseph,I've got nothing to hide.,
258,2.0,11.0,Joseph,It's actually starting to fill in.,
259,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"She'd refused him twice before, but since she was down to her last ovary Miranda decided she was in no position to eliminate men on the basis of hair plugs.",
260,2.0,11.0,Joseph,"- I'm telling you, I was practically bald.",
261,2.0,11.0,Miranda,- I remember.,
262,2.0,11.0,Joseph,Now I have hair.,
263,2.0,11.0,Joseph,This is a miracle.,
264,2.0,11.0,Joseph,- Some more bistee? -,
265,2.0,11.0,Miranda, Sure.,
266,2.0,11.0,Joseph,You probably think I'm crazy.,
267,2.0,11.0,Miranda,"Actually, I was thinking you seem very happy.",
268,2.0,11.0,Joseph,"The funny thing is, I never thought that I'd be the kind of guy to get plugs.",
269,2.0,11.0,Joseph,But I've learned that you should never say never.,
270,2.0,11.0,Miranda,I know what you mean.,
271,2.0,11.0,Miranda,There are things that I've considered lately that I never thought I would consider.,
272,2.0,11.0,Joseph,Like what? ,
273,2.0,11.0,Miranda,- Do you really want to know?,
274,2.0,11.0,Joseph,- Sure.,
275,2.0,11.0,Miranda,I recently found out that I have a lazy ovary.,
276,2.0,11.0,Miranda,Which is no big deal.,
277,2.0,11.0,Miranda,It just means that I only produce an egg every other month.,
278,2.0,11.0,Miranda,"I'm not even sure that I want kids, but all of a sudden it hit me that if the other ovary shuts down, I'm out of business.",
279,2.0,11.0,Miranda,I've started taking hormones and now I'm actually considering freezing my eggs.,
280,2.0,11.0,Joseph,Freezing your eggs? ,
281,2.0,11.0,Miranda,Like a fertility savings account. I think it would take the pressure off.,
282,2.0,11.0,Miranda,It removes the whole biological clock issue.,
283,2.0,11.0,Joseph,"- Yeah, but it raises a lot of other issues.",
284,2.0,11.0,Miranda,- Such as? ,
285,2.0,11.0,Joseph,"Such as, what is all this reproductive technology doing for us? Do we want desperate women having babies at 50? Maybe some people aren't supposed to procreate.",
286,2.0,11.0,Joseph,Maybe this is the world's way of weeding out the weak.,
287,2.0,11.0,Joseph,"If you ask me, this is a ridiculous abuse of science.",
288,2.0,11.0,Joseph,You have now designer sperm and these simulated wombs.,
289,2.0,11.0,Joseph,Here's a good idea.,

291,2.0,11.0,Miranda,I don't need to be lectured about science by a man who's doing crop rotation on his forehead.,
292,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Miranda went off the hormones.,
293,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Not because of what Joseph said, but because she was only 33 she still had her left ovary and she wasn 't ready to settle out of court.",
294,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Maybe someday there would be eggs in her freezer.,

305,2.0,11.0,Stephan,You're the one who doesn't want to make love.,
306,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,I wouldn't be so sure about that.,
307,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Charlotte was relieved and delighted to discover Stephan was definitely straight, or at least a gay straight man.",
308,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Frankly, after two orgasms, who the hell cares? The next morning, it dawned on Samantha that her desire for revenge was not as strong as her desire for Dominic.",

321,2.0,11.0,Dominic,- I said I was going.,
322,2.0,11.0,Samantha,Stop beating me to the punch! ,
323,2.0,11.0,Carrie,As she watched history repeat itself Samantha realized she couldn 't do what Dominic did because she hadn 't evolved past having feelings.,
324,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"In a way, that was nice to know.",
325,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- Good morning.,
326,2.0,11.0,Stephan,"- Good morning, sleepy.",
327,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,Something smells amazing!,
328,2.0,11.0,Stephan,It's warm cranberry buttermilk scones and lemon curd.,

335,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,- Are you sure?,
336,2.0,11.0,Stephan,- It's in that glue trap.,

342,2.0,11.0,Charlotte,Get it out! Get it away!,
343,2.0,11.0,Stephan,- My God!,
344,2.0,11.0,Carrie,At that moment Charlotte realized her masculine side wasn 't evolved enough for a man whose feminine side was as highly evolved as Stephan 's.,
345,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I spent the night at Big's for the first time since my stuff was kicked out of the nest.,
346,2.0,11.0,Big,- Where you going? ,

354,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I just have to make sure I didn't leave anything else.,
355,2.0,11.0,Carrie,"Suddenly, I realized I didn't have to worry about leaving something behind because I was there.",
356,2.0,11.0,Carrie,Okay.,
357,2.0,11.0,Carrie,I'll stay a little longer.,
358,2.0,11.0,Carrie,But I'm leaving this underwear here.,

341,2.0,12.0,Big,This isn't about us! This is about work!,
342,2.0,12.0,Carrie, This isn't about work. This is about us getting closer and you getting so freaked out that you have to put an ocean between us.,
343,2.0,12.0,Big,I don't want to talk about this anymore.,
344,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Why is it so hard for you to factor me into your life in any real way?,
345,2.0,12.0,Big,I guess old habits die hard.,
346,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Maybe I can't do this anymore.,

355,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Tied myself to a man who was terrified of being tied down.,

358,2.0,12.0,Stanford Blatch,Excuse me? ,
359,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Stanford panicked. He hadn 't been seen in his underwear by a roomful of men since seventh grade gym class.,
360,2.0,12.0,Large Imposing Man,"What's it gonna be, pal? In or out? ",
361,2.0,12.0,Carrie,"So, Rick9Plus undressed. It would have been rude to stand up Bigtool4U.",

363,2.0,12.0,Jack,Let's do it in bed.,
364,2.0,12.0,Carrie,"Suddenly, her fear of his fetish ended.",
365,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Miranda realized that Jack's excitement wasn't about getting caught.,
366,2.0,12.0,Carrie,It was about her and she really began to let loose.,
367,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Something she'd been unable to do outside.,
368,2.0,12.0,Elderly Woman,Jack? Is everything all right? ,
369,2.0,12.0,Miranda,Who was that?,

371,2.0,12.0,Elderly Woman,Son? ,
372,2.0,12.0,Miranda,They sound like they're coming in here. Are they coming in here? ,
373,2.0,12.0,Carrie,"At first, Stanford thought he'd be shunned for lack of the popular six-pack abs. But then ",
374,2.0,12.0,Gorgeous Young Hunk,Never seen that kind before.,
375,2.0,12.0,Stanford Blatch,They're French! I bought them in Paris.,

381,2.0,12.0,Stanford Blatch,Another beer for you?,
382,2.0,12.0,Gorgeous Young Hunk,Yeah.  I'll buy.,
383,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Stanford learned that sometimes a brief encounter can be quite fulfilling.,
384,2.0,12.0,Carrie,I went to bed at 1:00.,
385,2.0,12.0,Carrie,I was still wide-awake at 2:30.,
386,2.0,12.0,Carrie,There were no words left.,
387,2.0,12.0,Carrie,We'd said them all.,
388,2.0,12.0,CArrie,"After we made love, I knew it was over.",
389,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Did I ever really love Big or was I addicted to the pain? The exquisite pain of wanting someone so unattainable.,
390,2.0,12.0,Big,Hey. What are you doing over there? ,
391,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Go to Paris. I'm not gonna come.,
392,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Let's not pretend we're something we're not.,
393,2.0,12.0,Carrie,It's okay.,
394,2.0,12.0,Big,Come to bed.,
395,2.0,12.0,Carrie,"I wanted to go to him, but I felt like I was tied to the chair.",
396,2.0,12.0,Carrie,"Some part of me was holding me back, knowing I had gone too far.",
397,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Reached my limit.,
398,2.0,12.0,Carrie,"And just like that, I had untied myself from Mr.",
399,2.0,12.0,Carrie,Big.,
400,2.0,12.0,Carrie,I was free.,
401,2.0,12.0,Carrie,But there was nothing exquisite about it.,
0,2.0,13.0,Carrie,In a town where everyone's dying to couple up sometimes there's nothing better than being out of a relationship.,
1,2.0,13.0,Carrie,You have time to do your laundry freedom to play your favorite bad music really loudly.,
2,2.0,13.0,Carrie,But the best part of being out of a relationship: Plenty of time to catch up with your friends.,
3,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I feel sorry for Big.,
4,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"I really do, because if you think about it I was the best thing that ever happened to him.",
5,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Actually, I pity him.",
6,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Because I get to walk away and be me and he has to walk away and stay him.,
7,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Who wants to be him when you can be me? I'm smart.,
8,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I'm funny.,
9,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I was this thing.,
10,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I was it.,
11,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I was this magic moment.,
12,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I was the abracadabra.,
13,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"I was totally the ""poof"" in the relationship.",
14,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I've got more poof than he could ever have.,
15,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Sometimes, I poof just hailing a cab.",
16,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"So, I guess it's better to know now so I can go poof someone else.",
17,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Someone who deserves me and not some screwed up, insecure guy who can't deal with a woman who's got her act together.",
18,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Now, I'm gonna end up deliriously happy and Big is gonna die old and alone and I pity him.",
19,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Really, I pity him.",
20,2.0,13.0,Carrie,What? ,
21,2.0,13.0,Miranda,Who's gonna tell her? ,
22,2.0,13.0,Carrie,What? ,
23,2.0,13.0,Samantha,"You're obsessed with talking about Big and frankly, we can't take it anymore.",
24,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,- It's out of our league.,
25,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- Is this an intervention? ,
26,2.0,13.0,Miranda,"Yes, stop her before she obsesses again.",
27,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Isn't part of the breaking up process that you get free rein to whine to your friends?,
28,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,Of course you do.,
29,2.0,13.0,Miranda,But maybe you should think about whining to a shrink.,
30,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Why should I pay someone when we can talk for free and then get a drink or whatever? I don't need professional help.,
31,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I've got you guys.,
32,2.0,13.0,Samantha,For another ten minutes.,
33,2.0,13.0,Miranda,"Then we're cutting you off, cold turkey.",
34,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Hey, I don't need therapy.",
35,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I need new friends.,
36,2.0,13.0,Samantha,"Look, we're as fucked up as you are.",
37,2.0,13.0,Samantha,It's like the blind leading the blind.,
38,2.0,13.0,Miranda,Sometimes it helps to talk to somebody who's objective.,
39,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Okay, I understand why you see a shrink because you're always in your head but I'm fine.",
40,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I am functioning.,
41,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Besides, I don't really To be honest, I just don't buy the whole shrink thing.",
42,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,Neither do I.,
43,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,My parents believe that any head problem can be solved with physical exercise.,
44,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,That's why all of us are really good tennis players.,
45,2.0,13.0,Carrie,It's a slippery slope.,
46,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"First you go once a week, then three times a week and next thing you know you start sentences, ""My shrink says"" ",
47,2.0,13.0,Miranda,My shrink says that's a very common fear,
48,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Therapy is just so self-indulgent.,
49,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Ancient man didn't need shrinks to survive.,
50,2.0,13.0,Miranda,Ancient man only lived till 30.,
51,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Were my friends right? Had I crossed the line from pleasantly neurotic into annoyingly troubled? I decided to seek my own professional help.,
52,2.0,13.0,Stanford,How can you not have a shrink? This is Manhattan.,
53,2.0,13.0,Stanford,Even the shrinks have shrinks.,
54,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"The fact was, Stanford was right.",
55,2.0,13.0,Stanford,The therapist was as ubiquitous in Manhattan as pirated cable.,
56,2.0,13.0,Stanford,I have three.,
57,2.0,13.0,Carrie,You do not.,
58,2.0,13.0,Stanford,I do: One when I want to be cuddled one when I want tough love and one for when I just want to look at a really beautiful man.,
59,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- That's sick.,
60,2.0,13.0,Stanford,- Which is why I see the other two.,
61,2.0,13.0,Stanford,- Do you want a name? ,
62,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"No, Miranda's shrink referred me to one.",

67,2.0,13.0,Stanford,Gwyneth Paltrow sees her.,
68,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Why does she go to a shrink? ,
69,2.0,13.0,Stanford,She suffers from high self-esteem.,
70,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"While I was contemplating the couch, Miranda was enjoying hers.",
71,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Two nights later, she had another nocturnal rendezvous.",
72,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Soon, Miranda found herself with a nightly playmate.",

76,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Well, my friends can't handle me anymore.",
77,2.0,13.0,Carrie,You're like very expensive foster care.,
78,2.0,13.0,Dr. G,What's bothering them? ,
79,2.0,13.0,Carrie,They tell me that I talk about my ex-boyfriend too much.,
80,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"But that's normal, right, after a break up? ",
81,2.0,13.0,Dr. G,"I don't like the term ""normal.",
82,2.0,13.0,Carrie,""" No, of course you don't, because you wouldn't have any patients.",

88,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I don't know.,
89,2.0,13.0,Carrie,He was smart.,

94,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I was just along for the ride.,
95,2.0,13.0,Dr. G,What about you? Was this the first time you dated a man who couldn't give you what you wanted? ,
96,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Well, that's a little easy, don't you think?",
97,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Okay.,
98,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Yeah.,
99,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Maybe I've dated men who were wrong for me, but who hasn't? ",

101,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- What's your point?,
102,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- Maybe you are picking the wrong men.,
103,2.0,13.0,Samantha,"Well, of course you pick the wrong guys.",
104,2.0,13.0,Samantha,"Jesus, I could have told you that.",
105,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Frankly, I think I picked the wrong therapist.",
106,2.0,13.0,Carrie,She just did not get me at all.,
107,2.0,13.0,Carrie,She thought I was a game player.,
108,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,You have to be.,
109,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,It's the only way to deal with men.,
110,2.0,13.0,Miranda,That's healthy.,
111,2.0,13.0,Miranda,Relationships are not about games.,
112,2.0,13.0,Miranda,They're about mature and honest communication.,
113,2.0,13.0,Carrie,This from a woman who plays peek-a-boo with her neighbor.,
114,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,Games are empowering.,
115,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,"If you know what you're doing, you can control the situation.",
116,2.0,13.0,Samantha,The only place you can control a man is in bed.,
117,2.0,13.0,Samantha,"If we perpetually gave men blow jobs, we could run the world.",
118,2.0,13.0,Carrie,At least our hands would be free to greet dignitaries and stuff.,
119,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,Sorry.,
120,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,"I mean, even if you're in a relationship you still have to play games.",
121,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Big and I played games.,
122,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Look where it got us.,
123,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,But maybe the game is not really over.,
124,2.0,13.0,Charlotte,Maybe it's just halftime.,
125,2.0,13.0,Miranda,"That kind of delusional thinking is why you should be in therapy, too.",
126,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I do not pick the wrong guys.,
127,2.0,13.0,Carrie,They pick me.,
128,2.0,13.0,Miranda,"So what, you're like a fly strip for dysfunctional men? ",
129,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Yeah, but one of those really pretty floral scented ones.",
130,2.0,13.0,Samantha,It's slim pickings out there.,
131,2.0,13.0,Samantha,You can't swing a Fendi purse without knocking over five losers.,
132,2.0,13.0,Samantha,Where did all the great guys go? ,
133,2.0,13.0,Carrie,There it was: Happy hour in the valley of lost men.,
134,2.0,13.0,Samantha,Woah.,

140,2.0,13.0,Samantha,Let the games begin.,
141,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Sports night: Every female's fantasy a room full of captive heterosexual men all looking to be distracted during commercial breaks.,
142,2.0,13.0,Samantha,I'm getting a contact high from all the testosterone.,
143,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- We didn't order these.,

150,2.0,13.0,Samantha,If you ladies will excuse me.,
151,2.0,13.0,Samantha,I'm getting on the bench.,
152,2.0,13.0,Samantha,- Who's winning?,
153,2.0,13.0,Don,- Knicks.,

156,2.0,13.0,Samantha,Not yet.,
157,2.0,13.0,Don,- I'm Don.,
158,2.0,13.0,Samantha,- Samantha.,
159,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Don Seglar was a very successful importer of Mexican handbags.,x
160,2.0,13.0,Carrie,He was fanatical about two things: Keeping the price of foreign labor down and the Knicks.,
161,2.0,13.0,Don,- Maybe I can teach you a few things.,
162,2.0,13.0,Samantha,- And vice versa! ,
163,2.0,13.0,Don,It's 10 seconds left.,

169,2.0,13.0,Don,", go! Go! Score!",
170,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Which is exactly what Samantha did two hours later.,
171,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"When I got home that night, I couldn't get Charlotte's words out of my head.",
172,2.0,13.0,Carrie,We spent our childhoods playing games.,
173,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Were they all just primers for the games we played as adults? Were relationships just a big chess match: Strategy moves, countermoves all designed to keep your opponent off balance until you win? Was there such a thing as an honest relationship? Or was it true? Do you have to play games to make a relationship work? I went out with this girl on Saturday night.",
174,2.0,13.0,Dude in suit,We had a great time.,
175,2.0,13.0,Dude in suit,"I didn't call her again until Thursday, so I didn't seem eager.",

177,2.0,13.0,Lady in Cardigan,I thought we had a great time.,
178,2.0,13.0,Lady in Cardigan,The asshole doesn't call me until Thursday.,
179,2.0,13.0,Lady in Cardigan,I screened his call and didn't return it until Monday.,
180,2.0,13.0,Lady in Dress,I gave my boyfriend an ultimatum.,
181,2.0,13.0,Lady in Dress,Propose by Christmas or it's over.,
182,2.0,13.0,Lady in Dress,My girlfriends said that was a game.,
183,2.0,13.0,Lady in Dress,I think it was just smart.,
184,2.0,13.0,Lady in Dress,"Besides, if he doesn't come through, I can always secretly get pregnant.",
185,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"The next day, I reluctantly showed up for my second appointment with Dr.",
186,2.0,13.0,Carrie,G.,
187,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I was still a skeptic and I'd already read every New Yorker in the waiting room.,
188,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"When you think about it, what was I getting out of this anyway? And then, at five minutes to my last scheduled hour I got my answer.",
189,2.0,13.0,Carrie,My third appointment with Dr.,
190,2.0,13.0,Carrie,G: I had come a little early to catch up on my reading.,

196,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Well, I'm glad you did.",
197,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Especially since I had worn my new dress for the occasion.,
198,2.0,13.0,Seth,That New Yorker is from last year.,
199,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Well, this New Yorker is a little behind on her reading.",
200,2.0,13.0,Seth,"So, how long you been a Dr.",
201,2.0,13.0,Seth,G convert? ,
202,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Not very long, just three sessions.",
203,2.0,13.0,Seth,I just had my one-year anniversary.,
204,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"What'd she give you, a cake or something? ",
205,2.0,13.0,Seth,A really big bill.,
206,2.0,13.0,Seth,"Listen, this is gonna sound a little weird.",
207,2.0,13.0,Seth,Would you have dinner with me sometime? ,
208,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Sure. I'd like that.,
209,2.0,13.0,Seth,"- Call me, all right? ",
210,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- Okay.,
211,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Maybe it was unethical making a date with Seth Robinson, photographer, in my shrink's waiting room but there was something about him.",x
212,2.0,13.0,Dr. G,Come on in.,
213,2.0,13.0,Dr. G,"Well, you're dressed up.",
214,2.0,13.0,Carrie,He's a photographer.,
215,2.0,13.0,Samantha,- And you met him at your shrink's? ,
216,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- It wasn't a setup or anything.,
217,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Jeez, what if he's crazy? ",
218,2.0,13.0,Samantha,It's the crazy ones that have the good pills.,
219,2.0,13.0,Samantha,"That's it! Go, Marcus! Go!",
220,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Excuse me, but why is that on and who is Marcus? ",
221,2.0,13.0,Samantha,"Marcus Camby, Knicks forward.",
222,2.0,13.0,Samantha,"Now that Ewing is injured, he needs to pull it out.",
223,2.0,13.0,Carrie,When did we start caring about basketball?,
224,2.0,13.0,Samantha,Don is obsessed.,
225,2.0,13.0,Samantha,I don't get laid unless the Knicks win.,
226,2.0,13.0,Samantha,Can I just say? They and I have been on a very long losing streak.,
227,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- That's awful.,
228,2.0,13.0,Samantha,- No kidding.,
229,2.0,13.0,Samantha,The Knicks are the only ones getting screwed.,
230,2.0,13.0,Samantha,"Come on, you fuckers!",
231,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Why are you staying with him? ,
232,2.0,13.0,Samantha,"Because the sex, what I can remember, was unbelievable.",

234,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- Go.,
235,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Have sex.,

237,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Her date thought it was time they moved past peek-a-boo to playing doctor.,
238,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Miranda wanted to play fair, so she gave him a little tit for tat.",
239,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"All over town, people were getting lucky.",
240,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Seth and I were having a great first date at the coffee shop.,
241,2.0,13.0,Carrie,And what about the plant? I know.,
242,2.0,13.0,Seth,She always has it in a different place.,
243,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Maybe it's some sort of Dr.,
244,2.0,13.0,Carrie,G psychological test.,
245,2.0,13.0,Seth,- That's it.,
246,2.0,13.0,Seth,It's Where's Waldo.,
247,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- Yeah.,
248,2.0,13.0,Carrie,And it needs to be watered.,
249,2.0,13.0,Seth,- It's plastic.,
250,2.0,13.0,Carrie,- Are you sure? ,
251,2.0,13.0,Seth,I touched it.,
252,2.0,13.0,Carrie,You touched Dr.,
253,2.0,13.0,Carrie,G's plant?,
254,2.0,13.0,Seth,I've been going to her over a year.,
255,2.0,13.0,Seth,I got bored.,
256,2.0,13.0,Seth,Then you came along.,
257,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"- Well, that's sweet.",
258,2.0,13.0,Seth,"- No, it's true.",
259,2.0,13.0,Carrie,There was something about him.,
260,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I felt like I could talk to him about anything.,
261,2.0,13.0,Carrie,And in the spirit of psychological health and not playing games I decided to be honest.,
262,2.0,13.0,Carrie,I like you.,
263,2.0,13.0,Seth,"I like you, too.",
264,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Later that week, Miranda went shopping for dinner.",
265,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Shopping quickly devolved into a game of hide and seek.,
266,2.0,13.0,Miranda,I thought I'd be an adult here and come over and introduce myself.,
267,2.0,13.0,Miranda,Hi.,
268,2.0,13.0,Miranda,I'm Miranda.,
269,2.0,13.0,Miranda,You know.,
270,2.0,13.0,Mirana,Across the airshaft.,
271,2.0,13.0,Miranda's neighbor,"Yeah, right.",
272,2.0,13.0,Miranda's neighbor,You're the girl who lives above the guy I've been cruising.,
273,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Miranda realized she was still playing with an imaginary friend just like she did when she was five.,
274,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"The next day, she called her shrink for an emergency session.",
275,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Sam had decided she would celebrate the end of the basketball season and the return of her sex life by watching the final Knicks game at Don 's.",

277,2.0,13.0,Don,The Mets are playing Chicago.,
278,2.0,13.0,Don,"Now that basketball is over, I can give them my full attention.",
279,2.0,13.0,Don,They've been playing lousy ball this year.,
280,2.0,13.0,Carrie,The idea of lasting through another sexless season was more than Samantha could take.,
281,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"So, she forfeited the game.",
282,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, I was getting plenty of action.",
283,2.0,13.0,Carrie,Seth and I had just come back from another amazing date.,
284,2.0,13.0,Carrie,You want to come in?,
285,2.0,13.0,Seth,I think I already am.,

314,2.0,13.0,Carrie,"I believe in therapy, this moment is called ""the breakthrough.",

6,2.0,14.0,Skipper's date,"Skipper, you're a very sweet guy.",
7,2.0,14.0,Skipper's date,This isn't about anything you did.,
8,2.0,14.0,Skipper's date,It's just that we're in very different places right now.,
9,2.0,14.0,Skipper's date,We want different things from life.,
10,2.0,14.0,Skipper's date,I need to spend more time alone.,
11,2.0,14.0,Skipper,"So, actually, we want the same thing.",
12,2.0,14.0,Skipper,We both want to spend more time with you.,
13,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"Three months before that, it was a dental hygienist named Tiffany.",
14,2.0,14.0,Tiffany,"The timing is wrong, that's all.",
15,2.0,14.0,Tiffany,You're one of the nicest guys I've ever known.,

24,2.0,14.0,Miranda,I feel like I need to spend more time alone.,
25,2.0,14.0,Miranda,I've just reached a point in my life where I need to focus on my career.,
26,2.0,14.0,Miranda,I don't think that I have anything to give at the moment.,
27,2.0,14.0,Miranda,"Skipper, what else can I say? ",
28,2.0,14.0,Skipper,I have such horrible luck with women.,
29,2.0,14.0,Skipper,"I should've seen this coming, but I didn't because they wait for you to get relaxed and get comfortable before they bring the ice pick down between your eyes.",
30,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Not all women just the types of women you seem to be attracted to.,
31,2.0,14.0,Skipper,Over and over and over again.,
32,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Those ladies don't know what they're missing and missing and missing.,
33,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Skipper's pattern was clear to both of us.,
34,2.0,14.0,Carrie,He was a sweet guy who was perpetually attracted to women who were looking for jerks.,

40,2.0,14.0,Miranda,He had some wonderful insights.,
41,2.0,14.0,Miranda,"On the bright side, it was an interesting movie, right? ",

43,2.0,14.0,Miranda,The actor who played Carlo was charming.,
44,2.0,14.0,Kevin,He looked like he walked into work before the anesthesia wore off from his lobotomy.,
45,2.0,14.0,Miranda,"All right, I'll just get us a cab, okay?  ",
46,2.0,14.0,Miranda,Taxi! ,
47,2.0,14.0,Kevin,You gotta face uptown to get a cab around here.,
48,2.0,14.0,Miranda,I've caught plenty of cabs this way.,
49,2.0,14.0,Kevin,In never-never land where people confuse a lack of talent with charm.,
50,2.0,14.0,Kevin,"Come on, Gene Shalit, get in the damn cab.",

58,2.0,14.0,Miranda,The weird thing is when he tells me what to do in life it drives me crazy.,

60,2.0,14.0,Miranda,It's totally hot! ,
61,2.0,14.0,Charlotte,That looks like a good spot.,
62,2.0,14.0,Charlotte,"Everybody, check for park poo.",
63,2.0,14.0,Miranda,"Isn't that funny? That what I hate in life, I love in sex? ",
64,2.0,14.0,Samantha,"So, how about if you limit your contact with him to just sex? ",
65,2.0,14.0,Miranda,"That's a nice, healthy relationship.",
66,2.0,14.0,Miranda,I'm not ready yet to throw in the towel.,
67,2.0,14.0,Carrie,You're just ready to wrap it around his neck.,
68,2.0,14.0,Miranda,He's going through a very stressful time waiting to make partner at his firm.,
69,2.0,14.0,Miranda,"When that finally works out, I think he'll lighten up.",

72,2.0,14.0,Miranda,"- Wait a second, hold the eggs! What about Skipper? He never got angry.",
73,2.0,14.0,Carrie,- And you dumped him.,
74,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Fits a pattern.,
75,2.0,14.0,Samantha,- I don't have a pattern.,
76,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"In math, randomness is considered a pattern.",
77,2.0,14.0,Samantha,And I'm what they call a prime number.,
78,2.0,14.0,Miranda,She's got a very obvious pattern.,
79,2.0,14.0,Charlotte,I do? What? Tell me! ,
80,2.0,14.0,Miranda,You wait for a perfect guy to ask you on a perfect date ,
81,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"And when he does, you project this huge fantasy on him setting up these enormous expectations ",
82,2.0,14.0,Samantha,Which promptly blow up in your pretty face.,
83,2.0,14.0,Carrie,You put all your deviled eggs in one basket.,
84,2.0,14.0,Charlotte,That's a horrible pattern.,
85,2.0,14.0,Samantha,"Well, spread it around a little more.",
86,2.0,14.0,Samantha,Date a few guys at once and then you won't feel so disappointed.,
87,2.0,14.0,Carrie,- Are you asking Charlotte to juggle? ,
88,2.0,14.0,Samantha,It's all about multi-tasking.,
89,2.0,14.0,Samantha,"None of us can afford to fall into this ""one man at a time"" pattern.",
90,2.0,14.0,Samantha,Look at how much time you wasted with Big.,
91,2.0,14.0,Carrie,But Big was an aberration.,
92,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"Next time I meet a handsome, rich, emotionally unavailable 43-year-old man I'll know what to expect.",
93,2.0,14.0,Miranda,Will you? Or will you make the same mistake all over again? ,
94,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"I wondered were we all just victims of conditioned responses? Doomed to repeat the same unconscious relationship patterns? Were we all, in fact, just dating the same person over and over again? I guess I have dated quite a few artists.",
95,2.0,14.0,"Lady with red hair
",But I don't think they were all the same person.,
96,2.0,14.0,"Lady with red hair

",Handsome waspy assholes who treat me like shit.,
100,2.0,14.0,Man in Adidas shirt,I only date girls with Sony Playstations or breasts.,
101,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"That night, Samantha became acquainted with the new neighbors next door.",
102,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Though she had never met them she already knew them intimately.,
103,2.0,14.0,Carrie,The idea that someone else was having great sex and flaunting it was more than she could bear.,
104,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"So she decided, if you can 't join 'em beat it.",
105,2.0,14.0,Carrie,It all fit Samantha's pattern to a T having a wall between her and the person she was having sex with.,
106,2.0,14.0,Carrie,After a few weeks of not seeing Big I was beginning to fall into some familiar patterns of my own.,
107,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Staying out till 3:00 and sleeping till noon.,
108,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Ordering takeout from the same greasy Chinese and calling old friends who would always be there for me when I felt restless.,
109,2.0,14.0,John McFadden,McFadden.,
110,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"Hey John, it's Carrie.",

143,2.0,14.0,Carrie,- Sure.,
144,2.0,14.0,Carrie,And then I realized it.,
145,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"I didn't have a relationship pattern, I had a between-relationship pattern.",
146,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"I always went back to John after every devastating soul-shattering, gut-wrenching break up.",

149,2.0,14.0,John McFadden,"Thanks for the call, gorgeous.",
150,2.0,14.0,John McFadden,Sure put a cherry on my sundae.,
151,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Why had I been keeping him on the bench all these years? Did I really believe a relationship had to be difficult in order to work? Do you want to have dinner Friday night? ,
152,2.0,14.0,John McFadden,"Dinner? I should check my schedule, but I think I can make it.",
153,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Great.,

155,2.0,14.0,John McFadden,How about 8:15? ,
156,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"And just like that, I broke my pattern.",
157,2.0,14.0,Samantha,"Carrie, you can't date your fuck buddy.",
158,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Say it a little louder.,
159,2.0,14.0,Carrie,The lady in the last row didn't hear you.,
160,2.0,14.0,Samantha,You wanna take the only person in your life that's there purely for sex and make him a human being? Why? ,
161,2.0,14.0,Charlotte,"Excuse me, ""fuck buddy""? What is a ""fuck buddy""?  ",
162,2.0,14.0,Samantha,Come on.,
163,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"A fuck buddy is a guy you dated once or twice and it didn't go anywhere but the sex is so great, you sort of keep him on call.",
164,2.0,14.0,Samantha,"He's like ""dial-a-dick.",
165,2.0,14.0,Charlotte,""" You mean you just call this guy up when you're, you know, horny? ",

169,2.0,14.0,Samantha,He does have a life.,
170,2.0,14.0,Miranda,But you don't have to know about it.,

173,2.0,14.0,Miranda,Mine moved to Chicago but now we have phone sex.,

175,2.0,14.0,Mor,I have absolutely no idea.,
176,2.0,14.0,Carrie,"A few moments later, emboldened by our conversation and high from too many tantric headstands Charlotte asked a man out for the first time.",
177,2.0,14.0,Eric,"Man, that class was tough.",

180,2.0,14.0,Eric,Sure.,
181,2.0,14.0,Carrie,I wondered if Charlotte can break her pattern and ask out every man in Manhattan why couldn 't I have a deeper relationship with a man I have shallow sex with? Wow.,
182,2.0,14.0,John McFadden,You're all dressy.,
183,2.0,14.0,Carrie,I guess.,
184,2.0,14.0,Carrie,Thanks.,

113,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"I don't wanna send him there, I like him.",
114,2.0,16.0,Miranda,Could you believe that someone actually had the nerve to call this Florentine Peach?,
115,2.0,16.0,Carrie,I can't believe you spent this much on sheets.,
116,2.0,16.0,Miranda,It's an experiment. I'm trying to change my bed karma.,
117,2.0,16.0,Miranda,I figure if I can make my bed a place I really want to be...,
118,2.0,16.0,Miranda,...others will feel the same way.,
119,2.0,16.0,Carrie,The field of dreams.,
120,2.0,16.0,Mr,"Exactly. ”If you build it, he will come.”",
121,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"The thing that gets me is, I'm not usually wrong about the phone number size-up.",
122,2.0,16.0,Carrie,I don't put it out there unless I'm pretty sure it's coming back.,
123,2.0,16.0,Miranda,I'm either really loving or hating the color.,
124,2.0,16.0,Carrie,He thinks I'm ugly.,
125,2.0,16.0,Miranda,My God. Get a grip.,
126,2.0,16.0,Miranda,A guy doesn't call you for three days and you're ugly?,
127,2.0,16.0,Carrie,-What's your point? ,
128,2.0,16.0,Miranda,-Pillowcase.,
129,2.0,16.0,Miranda,It's amazing. We can feel totally good about ourselves...,
130,2.0,16.0,Miranda,...and then it all goes out the window if the guy doesn't mirror it that way back to us.,
131,2.0,16.0,Miranda,This has a little weird thing here.,
132,2.0,16.0,Miranda,Dammit. Does everything I bring into this bedroom have to have a flaw?,
133,2.0,16.0,Carrie,The next day I was in the Village looking for the perfect $7 dress...,
134,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"...to go with my $300 shoes, when....",
135,2.0,16.0,Carrie,I had a choice. I could turn around and run away...,
136,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"...or I could smile, be brave and walk on over.",
137,2.0,16.0,Carrie,Hi.,
138,2.0,16.0,Carrie,So what? Saturday's the day you stand on the street and smoke in the Village?,
139,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"Hi, I'm Carrie.",
140,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,-We're kind of in the middle of something. ,

147,2.0,16.0,Carrie,You're obviously in the middle of a thing with your lover...,
148,2.0,16.0,Carrie,...or whoever and I'm there....,
149,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,No. I'm not gay. I'm an alcoholic.,
150,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,We were just waiting for a meeting to start.,
151,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,I wanted to introduce you but it's supposed to be anonymous.,
152,2.0,16.0,Carrie,I really wasn't getting the gay vibe from you.,
153,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"It's just, he was so cute and....",
154,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,-I never called. ,
155,2.0,16.0,Carrie,-Right.,
156,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,I was freaked. I've only been in the program 11 months...,
157,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,...and my sponsor said I really shouldn't get involved with someone for a year.,
158,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"Okay, maybe you'll call me in a month.",
159,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,It doesn't bother you that I'm an alcoholic?,
160,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"God, no. I love alcoholics. Hell, I hope to be one someday.",

162,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,"-That's not funny, yet.",
163,2.0,16.0,Carrie,But it might be after a cappuccino.,
164,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,"What the fuck, it's only a couple of weeks.",
165,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,Would you like to go on a date sometime?,
166,2.0,16.0,Carrie,I can't think why not. You call me.,
167,2.0,16.0,Carrie,I accepted his kind invitation because when you think about it...,
168,2.0,16.0,Carrie,...aren’t we all in recovery from something?,
169,2.0,16.0,Carrie,Drinking? Drugging? Our last relationship?,
170,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"On our first date, Patrick and I went for coffee.",
171,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,"I'm really compulsive. If I open up a bag of Chips Ahoy, I gotta eat the whole thing.",
172,2.0,16.0,Carrie,I'm like that with Reese's Pieces. Reese's Pieces and shoes.,
173,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,Wouldn't the shoes be a little tough on digestion?,
174,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"This is me. Thank you, Mr. Casey. I had a great time.",
175,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,"No, Miss Burn Victim. I had the great time.",
176,2.0,16.0,Carrie,Then I gave him my very best lean-in-and-kiss-me-goodnight move.,
177,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"Our next date, over dinner, he told me about working his 12 steps.",
178,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"After dinner, I stood on my third step trying to work him.",
179,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,That smell is amazing. What is that?,
180,2.0,16.0,Carrie,Me.,
181,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,I'll call you.,
182,2.0,16.0,Carrie,I couldn't figure it out.,
183,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"I knew he wanted me, because during my lean-in-and-kiss-me-goodnight move...",
184,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"...I'd accidentally, on purpose felt his pop-up-and-say-hello.",
185,2.0,16.0,Carrie,What was going on?,
186,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"By the third date, I wanted him even more than a fistful of Reese's Pieces.",
187,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"Well then, goodnight.",
188,2.0,16.0,Carrie,That was that. I'd hit my humiliation limit.,
189,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"Then I thought, how many cute, smart, sexy, single, smoking alcoholics...",
190,2.0,16.0,Carrie,...are there left in the world? Five?,
191,2.0,16.0,Carrie,Do you want to come up?,
192,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,"Yeah, But you see, the thing is, I've never had sex sober.",
193,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,I've always been drunk or high. I don't know if I'll be any good.,
194,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,What the hell? Let's take it one step at a time.,
195,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,Sex is amazing. It feels so fucking amazing.,

201,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,-You're the best.  ,
202,2.0,16.0,Carrie,-I aim to please.,
203,2.0,16.0,Patrick Casey,After we have a cigarette...can we do it again?,
204,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"I'll have a Spanish omelet, hash browns, more coffee and orange juice.",
205,2.0,16.0,Carrie,Can I have some rice pudding for later? Thanks.,
206,2.0,16.0,Samantha,Storing up for winter?,
207,2.0,16.0,Carrie,"No, I'm starving. Patrick and I...All last night and I'm just....",
208,2.0,16.0,Charlotte,"No, don't stop, it's okay. Just because I'm bad in bed doesn't mean everybody has to be.",
209,2.0,16.0,Miranda,One more time. You are not bad in bed.,
210,2.0,16.0,Charlotte,Really? Has a man ever fallen asleep making love to you?,
211,2.0,16.0,Samantha,"No, but I once fell asleep when a guy was doing me. It was the ludes.",
212,2.0,16.0,Charlotte,It's okay.,
213,2.0,16.0,Charlotte,I'm mature enough to realize that while I may be good at some things like...,
214,2.0,16.0,Charlotte,"...accessories, that I might need help in others like....",
215,2.0,16.0,Samantha,-Fucking?   ,

217,2.0,16.0,Samantha,A fucking class?,
218,2.0,16.0,Charlotte,"No, a tantric sex workshop.",
219,2.0,16.0,Carrie,Just don't drink any suspicious Kool-Aid or put on new Nikes.,
220,2.0,16.0,Charlotte,It's not like that. It's taught by a well-respected woman psychologist.,
221,2.0,16.0,Charlotte,It's called ”How To Please A Man.”,
222,2.0,16.0,Miranda,I know how to please a man. Just give away most of your power.,

233,2.0,16.0,Carrie,...and waited for her in the bedroom.,
234,2.0,16.0,Carrie,Samantha began to wonder if maybe she was about to go too far.,
235,2.0,16.0,Carrie,Was she actually capable of being this sexually free?,
236,2.0,16.0,carrie,Or was she getting in over her head?,

250,2.0,16.0,David 1,"Sorry. It's very pretty, but no. It's not you, it's us.",
251,2.0,16.0,David 2,I have an idea. Let's all put on our clothes and go out for gelati!,
252,2.0,16.0,David 1,-Cheesecake. ,

262,2.0,16.0,Carrie,...he was in bed with a big bag of Chips Ahoy.,

265,2.0,16.0,Tantric instructor,...is to experience and merge with the Divine.,
266,2.0,16.0,Carrie,I think Patrick's addicted to me.,
267,2.0,16.0,Carrie,It's like he's replaced drinking with me.,
268,2.0,16.0,Miranda,Program guys are tough.,

295,2.0,17.0,Carrie,Charlotte really is in her 20s. She's got crabs.,
296,2.0,17.0,Samantha,My God!,
297,2.0,17.0,Carrie,"That night, I called Dr. Meego. I figured it was an emergency.",
298,2.0,17.0,Carrie,I have this thing about crabs.,
299,2.0,17.0,Carrie,I had them once in college and the experience scarred me for life.,
300,2.0,17.0,Carrie,I really I don’t think I can go back to that house until the mattresses are sanitized...,
301,2.0,17.0,Carrie,...and the sheets and towels are burned.,
302,2.0,17.0,Bradley Meego,I'm flattered you thought of me.,
303,2.0,17.0,Bradley Meego,I'd be happy to prescribe your friend some industrial-strength pubicide.,

312,2.0,17.0,Carrie,It was really nice.,
313,2.0,17.0,Carrie,I believe it was the first instance of a case of crabs moving a relationship forward.,
314,2.0,17.0,Carrie,"Every year, one of the local Hamptons billionaires got down and dirty...",
315,2.0,17.0,Carrie,...and threw a big hoedown full of cowboys and caviar.,

317,2.0,17.0,Carrie,We joined Samantha to lend our moral support.,
318,2.0,17.0,Samantha,I can't believe it.,
319,2.0,17.0,Samantha,There're people here who don't even come to my parties and they came to Nina's.,

323,2.0,17.0,Carrie,Where are you going?,
324,2.0,17.0,Samantha,To congratulate Nina. I may need her to hire me someday.,
325,2.0,17.0,Carrie,While Samantha set out to negotiate twenty-something detente...,
326,2.0,17.0,Carrie,...Charlotte prepared to launch a full-out war.,
327,2.0,17.0,Charlotte,Excuse me. Do you know that you gave me crabs?,

331,2.0,17.0,Charlotte,-That is so tacky.,
332,2.0,17.0,Greg,So is Iying about your age.,
333,2.0,17.0,Greg,I saw your driver license when you bought the beer last night.,
334,2.0,17.0,Charlotte,"I didn't lie. You made an assumption, I didn't contradict it.",
335,2.0,17.0,Greg,"Whatever. I may have given you crabs, but you deceived me.",
336,2.0,17.0,Greg,-That is so much worse.  ,
337,2.0,17.0,Charlotte,-Grow up.,

344,2.0,17.0,Man in cowboy costume,Could you please try to keep the young people out until after 11:00.,
345,2.0,17.0,Waitress,"We're all out of country-fried goat cheese, somebody got stuck with a cactus needle...",
346,2.0,17.0,Waitress,...and there are people outside who aren't on the fucking list.,
347,2.0,17.0,Nina Grabowski,Jesus fucking Christ. You are totally coked out.,
348,2.0,17.0,Waitress,You are totally jealous.,
349,2.0,17.0,Nina Grabowski,"My God, what is that?",
350,2.0,17.0,Nina Grabowski,What is that sound? My God! What’s happening?,
351,2.0,17.0,Nina Grabowski,That's not supposed to happen until midnight.,
352,2.0,17.0,Waitress,-I know.,
353,2.0,17.0,Nina Grabowski,-This is your problem. Get them to stop!,

358,2.0,17.0,Samantha,This is Greg. I think the two of you would really hit it off.,
359,2.0,17.0,Nina Grabowski,Hi.,
360,2.0,17.0,Carrie,"I began to realize, that the biggest threat twenty-something girls posed...",
361,2.0,17.0,Carrie,...was to themselves.,
362,2.0,17.0,Laurel Harris,I've been looking all over for you.,
363,2.0,17.0,Laurel Harris,"-Look, I got one just like yours.",
364,2.0,17.0,Carrie,-That's great.,
365,2.0,17.0,Laurel Harris,You want me to get you a Cosmopolitan?,
366,2.0,17.0,Carrie,"No. I'm gonna go find my date. But I'll see you later, okay?",
367,2.0,17.0,Laurel Harris,"That guy from the bookstore? My God, he was so cute.",
368,2.0,17.0,Carrie,"Annoying, yes. Dangerous, no.",
369,2.0,17.0,Carrie,They were simply our youthful doppelgangers...,
370,2.0,17.0,Carrie,...who needed our compassion more than anything.,
371,2.0,17.0,Carrie,And then everything I so firmly believed was promptly blown to pieces.,
372,2.0,17.0,Carrie,Is it you?,
373,2.0,17.0,Big,Hey. What are you doing here?,
374,2.0,17.0,Carrie,What am I doing here? What are you doing here?,
375,2.0,17.0,Big,I just got back this week from Paris.,
376,2.0,17.0,Big,This is Natasha.,
377,2.0,17.0,Natasha,Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard so much about you.,
378,2.0,17.0,Carrie,Really?,
379,2.0,17.0,Big,Natasha's parents have a house in East Hampton. We just came up for the weekend.,
380,2.0,17.0,Natasha,Excuse me. It's nice to meet you.,
381,2.0,17.0,Carrie,"I'm sorry, I'm just a little stunned here. And confused.",
382,2.0,17.0,Carrie,Who is she?,
383,2.0,17.0,Big,I meant to call you. She's this girl that I met in Paris.,
384,2.0,17.0,Big,She works for Ralph Lauren in Europe.,
385,2.0,17.0,Carrie,You're in from Paris for the weekends?,
386,2.0,17.0,Big,No. The Paris deal fell through. I planned on calling you.,
387,2.0,17.0,Big,I certainly didn't want to run into you like this.,
388,2.0,17.0,Carrie,You can't plan everything. Life can be pretty random.,
389,2.0,17.0,Carrie,"I'm here on a date, too, somewhere. He's a doctor, Bradley Meego.",
390,2.0,17.0,Carrie,"He's good on paper, probably like Natasha. Good-looking, sweet, blah-blah-blah.",
391,2.0,17.0,Carrie,"How old is she, anyway?",
392,2.0,17.0,Big,"I don't know, 26, 27.",
393,2.0,17.0,Carrie,Something like that.,
394,2.0,17.0,Carrie,I'll see you in the Hamptons or back in the city.,
395,2.0,17.0,Big,I promise to call when I get back into town.,
396,2.0,17.0,Miranda,"Carrie, are you okay?",
397,2.0,17.0,Carrie,"No, I just ran into Big. He's back from Paris.",
398,2.0,17.0,Carrie,He has a new girlfriend. She's 26.,
399,2.0,17.0,Miranda,-Where is he? I didn't see--  ,
400,2.0,17.0,Miranda,-God.,
401,2.0,17.0,Carrie,And then I realized...,
402,2.0,17.0,Carrie,...twenty-something girls are just fabulous...,
403,2.0,17.0,Carrie,...until you see one with the man who broke your heart.,
0,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Life is all about making choices.,
1,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"Some choices, like who you marry, are big...",
2,2.0,18.0,Carrie,...while others are even bigger.,
3,2.0,18.0,Carrie,What do you think?,
4,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"The $5 ones that last three days, or the $10 ones that last five days?",
5,2.0,18.0,Miranda,Either one.,
6,2.0,18.0,Carrie,-Three days.,
7,2.0,18.0,Flower vendor,-5,
8,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Another choice is how to deal with an ex-boyfriend.,
9,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"Some women handle it coolly, calmly, while others....",
10,2.0,18.0,Miranda,Fuck! Steve. Go!,
11,2.0,18.0,Flower vendor,$5! Come back here!,
12,2.0,18.0,Miranda,He just looked so hurt. Like a kid in one of those big-eyed velvet paintings.,
13,2.0,18.0,Charlotte,Poor Steve.,
14,2.0,18.0,Miranda,"I'm sorry, I panicked. What was I gonna do, stand around and chit-chat about the weather?",
15,2.0,18.0,Miranda,"-The man's been inside me, for god’s sake. ",
16,2.0,18.0,Charlotte,-Could I have more Sweet’n Low?,
17,2.0,18.0,Miranda,I've never been able to be friends with an ex-boyfriend.,
18,2.0,18.0,Miranda,"I meet those couples who stay friends and I think, ”How do they do that?”",
19,2.0,18.0,Samantha,I've never been able to be friends with any men. Why would I?,
20,2.0,18.0,Samantha,"Women are for friendships, men are for fucking.",
21,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"Honey, you gotta learn to form an opinion.",
22,2.0,18.0,Charlotte,"Friendship is the bonus of a relationship. If they don’t want relationship, they don’t get to be friends.",
23,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"So what? If you don’t make it a couple, you withhold friendship as a punishment?",
24,2.0,18.0,Charlotte,You make it sound so bad.,
25,2.0,18.0,Samantha,Black widow spiders bite the heads off their mates when they’re still with them.,
26,2.0,18.0,Samantha,Withholding friendship is letting them off easy.,
27,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"How can you imagine you guys, instead of the whole awful break-up scene...",
28,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"...just like you say, ”hey, you, come here”...and chomp their head off.",
29,2.0,18.0,Miranda,Believe me. I would love to be one of those people who's all:,
30,2.0,18.0,Miranda,"“We loved, thank you. You enriched my life. Now, go, prosper.”",
31,2.0,18.0,Miranda,"But I'm much more: ”We didn't work out, you need to not exist.” What?",
32,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"It's just so childish. Not you, the whole situation.",
33,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"I mean, we keep dresses we'll never wear again but we throw away our ex-boyfriends.",
34,2.0,18.0,Carrie,I'm not saying that I'm any better.,
35,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"I haven't been able to be friends with Big, but....",
36,2.0,18.0,Carrie,If you loved someone and you break up...where does the love go?,
37,2.0,18.0,Samantha,To their next girlfriend.,
38,2.0,18.0,Carrie,No. That is a different love.,
39,2.0,18.0,Carrie,There is no way the love that I had with Big is same thing he has with Natasha.,
40,2.0,18.0,Miranda,Natasha? When'd you stop calling her the Idiot Stick Figure With No Soul?,
41,2.0,18.0,Carrie,About three weeks ago when I saw them at Cafe M.,
42,2.0,18.0,Carrie,He was holding her hand and smiling and...I finally got it.,
43,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"They're happy, slash, we're over. It was okay.",
44,2.0,18.0,Samantha,"-Natasha, what a bullshit name. ",
45,2.0,18.0,Miranda,-Totally.,
46,2.0,18.0,Charlotte,-Stupid.  ,
47,2.0,18.0,Carrie,-Complete bullshit.,
48,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"Later that night, I got to thinking about the ex factor.",
49,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"In mathematics, we learned that ”x” stands for the unknown.",
50,2.0,18.0,Carrie,“a” plus ”b” equals ”x.”,
51,2.0,18.0,Carrie,But what's really unknown is: what plus what equals friendship with an ex?,
52,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Is this an unsolvable equation?,
53,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Or is it possible to transform a once-passionate love...,
54,2.0,18.0,Carrie,...into something that fits nice and easily onto the friendship shelf?,
55,2.0,18.0,Carrie,I couldn’t help but wonder...can you be friends with an ex?,
56,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"That Sunday afternoon, Miranda was sitting at home enjoying a biscotti and the paper when...",
57,2.0,18.0,Carrie,There it was...her ex's head.,
58,2.0,18.0,Steve,I hear you breathing.,
59,2.0,18.0,Miranda,Yeah. Hi!,
60,2.0,18.0,Steve,"That was a shitty thing you did, running away from me on the street.",

62,2.0,18.0,Steve,You ran.,
63,2.0,18.0,Miranda,I wasn't expecting to see you…,
64,2.0,18.0,Steve,It really hurt my feelings.,
65,2.0,18.0,Miranda,I don't do very well with ex-boyfriends and...,
66,2.0,18.0,Steve,This is me. Steve. I held your head while you were sleeping.,
67,2.0,18.0,Miranda,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.,
68,2.0,18.0,Steve,It's okay.,
69,2.0,18.0,Miranda,I hadn't seen you in so long and I missed you and then I did that shitty thing.,
70,2.0,18.0,Steve,-It wasn't that shitty. ,
71,2.0,18.0,Miranda,-It was. ,
72,2.0,18.0,Miranda,It was a shitty thing. I'm a shitty person.,
73,2.0,18.0,Steve,-You are not a shitty person. ,
74,2.0,18.0,Miranda,-I am! I am shitty! You'd never do anything that shitty.,
75,2.0,18.0,Steve,How do you call showing up at your apartment in the middle of afternoon and calling you shitty?,
76,2.0,18.0,Miranda,"Yeah, that was pretty shitty.",
77,2.0,18.0,Steve,You've got a ”bat in the cave.”,
78,2.0,18.0,Miranda,"I miss you. Whenever something funny happens, I always want to tell you about it.",
79,2.0,18.0,Steve,"So tell me. Just ’cause we could make it a couple doesn't mean we can't have a friendly meal, does it?",
80,2.0,18.0,Miranda,I guess not.,
81,2.0,18.0,Steve,What are you doing Friday?,
82,2.0,18.0,Miranda,I have a date.,
83,2.0,18.0,Steve,"Looking forward to it, are you?",

85,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"...Charlotte came face to face with the memory of her first...her horse, Taddy.",
86,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Charlotte's relationship with Taddy ended sadly...,
87,2.0,18.0,Carrie,...when he threw her during a teen equestrian competition...,
88,2.0,18.0,Carrie,...causing her to break her collarbone and lose the blue ribbon.,
89,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Her father promptly sold Taddy to another family and she hadn't been on a horse since.,
90,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Charlotte wondered if it was time to get back in the saddle again.,
91,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, across town...Samantha was about to see a stallion of her own.",

93,2.0,18.0,Samantha,"Excuse me, but do I know you?",
94,2.0,18.0,Mr. Cocky,Not yet. I was thinking maybe you'd have dinner with me sometime.,
95,2.0,18.0,Samantha,What makes you think that?,
96,2.0,18.0,Mr. Cocky,The way you were just checking me out.,
97,2.0,18.0,Samantha,You get 10 points for directness.,

100,2.0,18.0,Mr. Cocky,I'll tell you what...Here's my business card. You call me.,
101,2.0,18.0,Samantha,Blatantly picking a woman up on the street. How'd you get to be so cocky?,
102,2.0,18.0,Mr. Cocky,"I was born that way, I guess.",
103,2.0,18.0,Mr. Cocky,At least consider meeting me for a friendly little drink.,
104,2.0,18.0,Samantha,"I'll think about it, Mr. Cocky.",
105,2.0,18.0,Mr. Cocky,Please do.,
106,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"It was later that week, when I spotted a Laura Ashley dress, circa 1988...",
107,2.0,18.0,Carrie,...still hanging in my closet...,
108,2.0,18.0,Carrie,...that I decided it was time to give my ex a friendly phone call.,
109,2.0,18.0,Carrie,I hadn't planned on the Idiot Stick Figure With No Soul answering.,

119,2.0,18.0,Carrie,I'm A-OK.,
120,2.0,18.0,Big,You sound a little nuts.,
121,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Can't you let one go by? This is weird. The first call.,
122,2.0,18.0,Big,Right.,
123,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Maybe I'd...do better if I went with my little prepared speech.,
124,2.0,18.0,Big,"You have a speech, do you?",
125,2.0,18.0,Carrie,I was wondering what you thought of...,
126,2.0,18.0,Carrie,...instead of pretending each other doesn't exist...,
127,2.0,18.0,Carrie,...we try to be friends or something?,
128,2.0,18.0,Big,I'd like that.,
129,2.0,18.0,Big,"I've been meaning to call you, but I didn’t know if you wanted to hear from me--",

143,2.0,18.0,Carrie,"And that's when I realized, Big was nervous.",
144,2.0,18.0,Carrie,It was odd. The new ”friend” part of me felt incredibly compassionate...,

146,2.0,18.0,Carrie,-You okay?  ,
147,2.0,18.0,Big,-Fine.,

238,2.0,18.0,Samantha,I'm not most women. Unzip and get over here.,
239,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Samantha suddenly understood what made Mr. Cocky so cocky.,
240,2.0,18.0,Samantha,"I'm telling you, it was like a wall of flesh coming at me.",
241,2.0,18.0,Carrie,Nothing is scarier than a really big one coming at you.,
242,2.0,18.0,Samantha,"I didn't even want my mouth near it, I was afraid I'd get lockjaw.",
243,2.0,18.0,Samantha,It was quite a shock. His hands are relatively tiny.,

328,2.0,18.0,Charlotte,I can’t believe he had the nerve to invite you.,

What happened to the time when a bad kiss or a cigarette or a ridiculous dream was part of a person's portfolio? In today's dating market, is it wise to liquidate certain stocks, the first sign they might not perform as well as expected? Or are there things one should try and negotiate?

460,3.0,5.0,Adeena,This is a black thing.,
461,3.0,5.0,Adeena,Please go and leave my brother alone.,
462,3.0,5.0,Carrie,"As Samantha turned to leave, she realised this wasn't a black thing.",
463,3.0,5.0,Carrie,It was a Samantha thing.,
464,3.0,5.0,Carrie,She'd never backed down to a bitch and she wasn't about to start.,

483,3.0,5.0,Carrie,Samantha knewthe real problem wasn't her white pussy.,
484,3.0,5.0,Carrie,It was that Chivon was a black pussy who wouldn't stand up to his sister.,

486,3.0,5.0,Carrie,It was too bad we had to end.,

128,3.0,6.0,Charlotte,It really is good.,

136,3.0,6.0,Charlotte,"You fucking bitch, you fucking whore.",
137,3.0,6.0,Alexander Lemley,"My God, are you sure? That's terrible.",
138,3.0,6.0,Alexander Lemley,That's a horrible thing to say.,
139,3.0,6.0,Alexander Lemley,I had no idea.,
140,3.0,6.0,Alexander Lemley,I just get lost in the moment.,
141,3.0,6.0,Alexander Lemley,I don't think that about you.,
142,3.0,6.0,Alexander Lemley,"Believe me, you are sweet, smart and lovely.",
143,3.0,6.0,Alexander Lemley,You are the kind of woman I hope to marry some day.,

151,3.0,6.0,Miranda,"I can't tonight, I have chlamydia.",
152,3.0,6.0,Steve,"I don't even knowwhat that is, but it sounds like a problem.",
153,3.0,6.0,Miranda,It's not a big deal.,
154,3.0,6.0,Miranda,It's just a sexually transmitted disease.,
155,3.0,6.0,Miranda,I might have given it to you or you to me.,
156,3.0,6.0,Miranda,"Either way, you should get tested.",
157,3.0,6.0,Steve,I'm afraid of doctors.,
158,3.0,6.0,Steve,I don't even have one.,
159,3.0,6.0,Miranda,Go to the free clinic.,
160,3.0,6.0,Miranda,Whatever.,
161,3.0,6.0,Steve,"What's gonna happen, does it hurt when you pee? ",
162,3.0,6.0,Miranda,"Men are just Carriers, there aren't any symptoms at all.",
163,3.0,6.0,Steve,Then why do I need to know? ,
164,3.0,6.0,Miranda,If you don't get treated you can pass it on to other people.,
165,3.0,6.0,Steve,"You are my only other person, and you already have it.",
166,3.0,6.0,Miranda,"Yeah, but if you've got it, we'll keep passing it back and forth.",

262,3.0,6.0,Aidan,I thought a bath would help you relax.,
263,3.0,6.0,Aidan,You seemed kind of tense.,
264,3.0,6.0,Carrie,Are you sure this isn't just a cheap ploy to see me naked? ,
265,3.0,6.0,Aidan,Will you be naked? ,
266,3.0,6.0,Carrie,That's the thing about baths.,

293,3.0,6.0,Samantha,They practically chased me like I was Fuckenstein.,
294,3.0,6.0,Carrie,They can't evict you for having sex.,
295,3.0,6.0,Samantha,"They're jealous, dried up old farts who haven't had sex since Eisenhower.",
296,3.0,6.0,Samantha,I remind them of what they can't have.,
297,3.0,6.0,Samantha,It might be time to move.,
298,3.0,6.0,Carrie,You can't.,
299,3.0,6.0,Carrie,You have a rent-controlled apartment on the Upper East Side.,
300,3.0,6.0,Samantha,"This isn't rent control, it's life control.",
301,3.0,6.0,Carrie,"I have to go, I have a date with Aidan.",
302,3.0,6.0,Samantha,Don't tell me you're not having sex yet.,
303,3.0,6.0,Carrie,- We're not having sex yet.,
304,3.0,6.0,Samantha,- What are you doing? ,

313,3.0,6.0,Carrie,"And he was doing his best to be the strong, silent type.",
314,3.0,6.0,Charlotte,- What's the matter?,
315,3.0,6.0,Alexander Lemley,- I'm afraid to come.,
316,3.0,6.0,Charlotte,What are you talking about? I'm close.,
317,3.0,6.0,Charlotte,Go ahead.,
318,3.0,6.0,Alexander Lemley,"You fucking bitch, you fucking whore! I hate myself, what's wrong with me?",
319,3.0,6.0,Carrie,"That night, Alexander decided to stop seeing Charlotte and start seeing a therapist.",

322,3.0,6.0,Steve,That doctor with the swab Ouch! I don't even want to swab my ears.,

329,3.0,6.0,Miranda,"It's No, I can't tell you",
330,3.0,6.0,Miranda,I've never told anybody my number.,
331,3.0,6.0,Steve,I'm just curious.,
332,3.0,6.0,Miranda,You won't judge me?,
333,3.0,6.0,Steve,I spent a day at the free clinic.,

350,3.0,6.0,Carrie,"Note, men who have had a lot of sexual partners are not called sluts.",
351,3.0,6.0,Carrie,They are called very good kissers.,
352,3.0,6.0,Carrie,A few are even called romantics.,
353,3.0,6.0,Aidan,I can't believe you've never been to the Blue Note.,
354,3.0,6.0,Aidan,- Call yourself a New Yorker.,
355,3.0,6.0,Carrie,- I've never done a lot of things.,
356,3.0,6.0,Aidan,I can think of one thing in particular.,
357,3.0,6.0,Carrie,- That I've done.,
358,3.0,6.0,Aidan,- I can think of one other thing.,
359,3.0,6.0,Aidan,What do you think about me staying the night?,
360,3.0,6.0,Carrie,I don't know.,
361,3.0,6.0,Carrie,What about Pete?,
362,3.0,6.0,Aidan,I arranged for the super's kid to walk Pete and feed him.,
363,3.0,6.0,Carrie,And you knewthis all night? And then something weird happened.,
364,3.0,6.0,Carrie,"For the first time in a long time, I was nervous.",
365,3.0,6.0,Carrie,We were going to sleep together and it was going to mean something.,
366,3.0,6.0,Carrie,"I was no virgin, but this was definitely virgin territory.",
367,3.0,6.0,Aidan,Good morning.,
368,3.0,6.0,Carrie,Good morning.,
369,3.0,6.0,Aidan,"OK, that's what I wanted.",
370,3.0,6.0,Aidan,Bye.,
371,3.0,6.0,Carrie,"The nice thing about a new relationship, it's a clean slate.",

373,3.0,6.0,Samantha,"Good morning, ladies.",
374,3.0,6.0,Carrie,"Whores were whores, men were women and rents higher.",
375,3.0,6.0,Samantha,"Easy, that's my bed.",
0,3.0,7.0,Carrie,It happened two days ago.,
1,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Aidan and I had been seeing each other for three weeks when ,
2,3.0,7.0,Aidan,- What is it? Bad dream?,
3,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- I'm not sure.,
4,3.0,7.0,Aidan,- What's wrong?,
5,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- I don't know.,
6,3.0,7.0,Carrie,The truth was I really didn't.,
7,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"The next day I searched for unpaid bills, unanswered calls, unmet deadlines.",
8,3.0,7.0,Carrie,But I hadn't so much as missed a teeth cleaning.,
9,3.0,7.0,Carrie,My life appeared to be in order.,
10,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"But the next night, like clockwork I realized I was in an existential crisis.",
11,3.0,7.0,Carrie,One that not even the sight of this season's Dolce & Gabbana sandals could lift me out of.,
12,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Do you wanna spend the night? ,
13,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- I'm gonna get some water.,
14,3.0,7.0,Aidan,- Relax.,
15,3.0,7.0,Aidan,I'll get it.,
16,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Then I realized it.,
17,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"What was wrong was, for the first time in my life, I was in a relationship where absolutely nothing was wrong.",
18,3.0,7.0,Carrie,It's smooth sailing.,
19,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"Nothing but calm seas, blue horizons.",
20,3.0,7.0,Carrie,See what I'm saying? ,
21,3.0,7.0,Miranda,Absolutely.,
22,3.0,7.0,Miranda,Not a cloud in sight.,
23,3.0,7.0,Carrie,We adore each other.,
24,3.0,7.0,Carrie,We have fun.,
25,3.0,7.0,Carrie,We mesh.,
26,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,And this is a problem? ,
27,3.0,7.0,Carrie,It feels odd.,
28,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm used to the hunt.,
29,3.0,7.0,Carrie,This iseffortless.,
30,3.0,7.0,Carrie,It's freaking me out.,
31,3.0,7.0,Samantha,I totally understand.,
32,3.0,7.0,Samantha,You're not getting the stomach flip.,
33,3.0,7.0,Miranda,Which is just a fear of losing the guy.,
34,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Maybe I'm not used to being with someone who doesn't do the seductive withholding dance.,
35,3.0,7.0,Miranda,But there is an upside to being with a guy with no surprises.,
36,3.0,7.0,Miranda,"Steve is completely predictable, but that's what I love about him.",
37,3.0,7.0,Miranda,He's so comfortable and safe.,
38,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Are you dating a man or a mini-van? ,
39,3.0,7.0,Miranda,My new favorite thing to do on a Saturday night is Steve's laundry and I've never been happier.,
40,3.0,7.0,Samantha,Your relationship is my greatest fear realized.,
41,3.0,7.0,Samantha,"I understand your dilemma and from my experience, if he seems too good to be true, he probably is.",
42,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,I don't believe this.,
43,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Nowwe're dumping guys for being too available.,
44,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,This is all solid proof of what I've read in this great new book.,
45,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"It says if you really wanna get married, you shouldn't spend so much time around dysfunctional single women.",
46,3.0,7.0,Miranda,"""Marriage lncorporated: ""Howto apply successful business strategies to finding a husband"".",
47,3.0,7.0,Samantha,"Chapter one: ""How To Get Ahead By Giving Head"".",
48,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Fine! Make fun.,
49,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,It's a very smart book.,
50,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,It encourages professional women to approach finding a mate with the dedication and organization they bring to their careers.,
51,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm more a student of chaos theory.,
52,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"If you don't see as much of me, I'm with my married friends.",
53,3.0,7.0,Miranda,And howwill this help you meet your mate? ,
54,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Bachelor friends of married men are the city's greatest untapped resource.,
55,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,The way to meet them is through the husbands.,
56,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,So my first assignment is to befriend the husbands.,
57,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,It's my new job.,
58,3.0,7.0, Carrie,"That evening, as Charlotte began her new career as a husband-hunter, Miranda returned home to feather her stress-free love nest.",
59,3.0,7.0,Steve,- I heated up some leftover lasagne.,
60,3.0,7.0,Miranda,- Great.,
61,3.0,7.0,Miranda,I'm starving.,
62,3.0,7.0,Steve,- Wanna get some plates?,
63,3.0,7.0,Miranda,- What for? It's just us.,
64,3.0,7.0,Carrie,An hour later it was on to dessert.,
65,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Followed by exactly eight minutes of no-frills sex.,
66,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"And 12 minutes of ""Front Line"".",
67,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Theirs was the kind of closeness that only came from true intimacy.,
68,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Samantha was experiencing intimacy that only came from anonymity.,
69,3.0,7.0,Carrie,His name was Dr.,
70,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Mark Raskin.,
71,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"An ear, nose and throat man that Samantha met actually we're not sure where.",x
72,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Suffice to say it happened quickly.,
73,3.0,7.0,Mark Raskin,"Will you get me some water, please?",
74,3.0,7.0,Samantha,- What for?,
75,3.0,7.0,Mark Raskin,- I want to take a hit of Viagra.,
76,3.0,7.0,Samantha,Number one - that's very presumptuous of you.,
77,3.0,7.0,Samantha,"And number two - from what I can tell, you don't need any help in that area whatsoever.",
78,3.0,7.0,Mark Raskin,I don't need it.,
79,3.0,7.0,Mark Raskin,I just take it recreationally.,
80,3.0,7.0,Samantha,What does it do for you? ,
81,3.0,7.0,Mark Raskin,Sends me on a rocket trip right through your solar system.,
82,3.0,7.0,Samantha,I'll be right back with that water.,
83,3.0,7.0,Carrie,While Samantha enjoyed the thrill of the new and Miranda's relationship happily floated on a placid sea I was searching for hidden icebergs.,
84,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Why are you still single?,
85,3.0,7.0,Aidan,- Why are you still single?,
86,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- Don't do that.,
87,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I hate it when guys act all cute.,
88,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- What? -,
89,3.0,7.0,Aidan,Waiting for an apology.,
90,3.0,7.0,Carrie,OK.,
91,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm a bitch.,
92,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm sorry.,
93,3.0,7.0,Carrie,You should know I get a tad bitchy from time to time.,
94,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm sure you have your bad traits.,
95,3.0,7.0,Carrie,And they would be? ,
96,3.0,7.0,Aidan,- Alphabetically?,
97,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- Whatever you got.,
98,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"It's all gonna come out eventually, so I'd like to know now and that way I can decide if I'd like to deal with it or not.",
99,3.0,7.0,"Aidan
",This is the strangest two blocks I ever walked.,
100,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"Again I'm sorry, but this relationship cannot just sail on like it is: perfect.",
101,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"Frankly, I can't take the pressure.",
102,3.0,7.0,Aidan,OK.,
103,3.0,7.0,Aidan,I'm gonna kiss you now.,
104,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Seriously.,
105,3.0,7.0,Carrie,What the hell is wrong with you that you're not married? ,
106,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- Tell me.,
107,3.0,7.0,Aidan,- Can't you relax and go with the flow.,
108,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"Go with the flow? No, I can't do that.",
109,3.0,7.0,Carrie,It's so seventies.,
110,3.0,7.0,Aidan,How long you think this phase is gonna last? My folks are coming this weekend and I want you to meet them.,
111,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- That's so,
112,3.0,7.0,Aidan,- Fifties? ,
113,3.0,7.0,Carrie,That is really nice.,
114,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"So, these parents that are coming to town do they know what's wrong with you? Let's get you a doughnut.",

116,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"The next evening, taking a page from ""Marriage lncorporated"", Charlotte had dinner with her married friends, Amy and Dennis.",
117,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Allow me to get right to the point.,
118,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"After careful consideration, I've decided that I'm getting married.",
119,3.0,7.0,Amy,"- Charlotte, that's wonderful! ",
120,3.0,7.0,Dennis,- Who's the lucky guy?,
121,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,I don't know yet.,
122,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,That's where you two come in.,
123,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Dennis, name one great single friend that you have to fix me up with.",
124,3.0,7.0,Dennis,I don't know.,
125,3.0,7.0,Dennis,No one you'd like offhand.,
126,3.0,7.0,Amy,- What about Phil?,
127,3.0,7.0,Dennis,"- Phil, yeah.",
128,3.0,7.0,Dennis,If he can tear himself away from his internet company to go on a date.,x
129,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Yes! Phil.,
130,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Phil, Phil, Phil.",
131,3.0,7.0,Amy,He is so nice and cute.,
132,3.0,7.0,Dennis,- You think Phil's cute?,
133,3.0,7.0,Amy,- He's cute.,
134,3.0,7.0,Dennis,I can see that.,
135,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Great.,
136,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Then it's all set up.,
137,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,I'll call you tomorrowto follow up.,
138,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Look! I have tickets to the opera on Saturday night.,
139,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,- I would like to take Phil.,
140,3.0,7.0,Amy,- Great.,
141,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"The next morning before work, while sorting Steve's laundry, Miranda came face to face with the true meaning of intimacy.",
142,3.0,7.0,Miranda,I was wrong.,
143,3.0,7.0,Miranda,There is a point where a couple can get too comfortable.,
144,3.0,7.0,Miranda,I reached it this morning washing Steve's underwear.,
145,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"Why, what happened?",
146,3.0,7.0,Miranda,"- I'm living with ""skid marks"" guy.",
147,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"- Oh, no! Terrible.",
148,3.0,7.0,Miranda,I don't get it.,
149,3.0,7.0,Miranda,Why do men get skid marks? Is it laziness? Or are they just in a rush? ,
150,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I don't know but it goes hand in hand with urinating on the seat.,
151,3.0,7.0,Miranda,I tell you one thing.,
152,3.0,7.0,Miranda,"When your boyfriend is so comfortable he can't be bothered to wipe his ass, that's the end of romance.",
153,3.0,7.0,Carrie,It's certainly the end of laundry night.,
154,3.0,7.0,Miranda,It got me thinking.,
155,3.0,7.0,Miranda,Maybe I mistake falling into a rut with intimacy.,
156,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- How often are you having sex?,
157,3.0,7.0,Miranda,- Often enough.,
158,3.0,7.0,Miranda,But it's totally generic.,
159,3.0,7.0,Miranda,We've got every move down pat.,
160,3.0,7.0,Miranda,It's more like a race to have an orgasm.,
161,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"- It's nice to be a contestant, isn't it?",
162,3.0,7.0,Miranda,- Sure.,
163,3.0,7.0,Miranda,I know what you mean.,
164,3.0,7.0,Miranda,"We whine when we don't have a boyfriend, we whine when we do.",
165,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Do you remember how Big kept me away from his mother?,
166,3.0,7.0,Miranda,- I remember.,
167,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"- And how pissed it used to make me? Now, Aidan's offering both his parents on a silver platter and I'm not sure I want to meet them.",
168,3.0,7.0,Miranda,Maybe it's too soon.,
169,3.0,7.0,Miranda,I've never met Steve's mother and I'm in no rush.,
170,3.0,7.0,Carrie,The irony is Aidan's acting exactly how I wish Big would have behaved.,
171,3.0,7.0,Carrie,And I'm behaving just like Big.,
172,3.0,7.0,Miranda,Maybe you don't believe it's for real unless somebody plays hard to get.,
173,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"When things come too easy, we're suspect.",
174,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Do they have to get complicated before we believe they're for real? We're raised to believe that true love never runs smoothly.,
175,3.0,7.0,Carrie,There always have to be obstacles in Act Two before you can live happily ever after in Act Three.,
176,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"But what happens when the obstacles aren't there? Does that mean there's something missing? Do we need drama to make a relationship work? A few days later, still hearing no word from Dennis about her date Charlotte made a call to his office.",
177,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Charlotte Yorke.,
178,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,He can reach me at home or at work and it's very important because I have tickets to the opera on Saturday.,
179,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Never mind, just have him call me.",
180,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"Her call unanswered, Charlotte followed up persistently.",
181,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Can you tell Dennis that Charlotte Yorke called? Yes, he'll knowwhat it's regarding.",
182,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"It's regarding my future husband, Phil.",
183,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,OK? Thank you.,
184,3.0,7.0,Dennis,Hi.,
185,3.0,7.0,Dennis,You've reached the office of Dennis Fincher.,
186,3.0,7.0,Dennis,I'm either out of the office or away from my desk.,
187,3.0,7.0,Dennis,Please leave a message at the sound of the tone.,
188,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Well.,
189,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Obviously, you have some good reason for keeping Phil and I apart.",
190,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,I can't imagine what it is but this is Phil's loss and not mine and don't bother returning this call either.,
191,3.0,7.0,Carrie,While Charlotte was a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown my anxiety-free relationship was driving me crazy.,
192,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Excuse me.,

203,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I've been thinking about this meeting your parents.,
204,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- I just wondered if it's a good idea.,
205,3.0,7.0,Aidan,- They gonna love you.,
206,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"No, I'm not worried about that.",
207,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Parents always think I'm adorable.,
208,3.0,7.0,Aidan,- What's the problem?,
209,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- Well What if they love me and if we break up you'll always have to explain to them what happened to the adorable girl.,
210,3.0,7.0,Aidan,- Are you breaking up with me? ,

217,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- Maybe that's good.,

219,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"You're so available to me, and I'm so available to you.",
220,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Maybe we're both too available.,

227,3.0,7.0,Carrie,This is nuts.,
228,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm sabotaging the best relationship I've ever had.,
229,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,It's better to have a man waiting for you than the other way around.,
230,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- I guess.,
231,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"- And if you hadn't been available, I'd be here alone, just some pathetic dateless freak.",
232,3.0,7.0,Carrie,So glad it worked out for you.,

240,3.0,7.0,Dennis,I'm so sorry.,
241,3.0,7.0,Dennis,I just got back from a business trip.,
242,3.0,7.0,Dennis,My secretary gave me all your messages.,
243,3.0,7.0,Dennis,I had no idea you wanted to meet Phil so badly.,
244,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Well, he sounded nice.",
245,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,It's not a big deal.,

253,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,"- ""Aida.""",
254,3.0,7.0,Samantha, I guess I'm in for another wild ride.,
255,3.0,7.0,Mark Raskin,- I'd say we both are.,
256,3.0,7.0,Samantha,What would happen if I tried one of these? ,
257,3.0,7.0,Mark Raskin,I don't think they've established that it works for women.,
258,3.0,7.0,Samantha,"There's no harm in trying is there, doctor? Bottoms up! ",
259,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Samantha officially became the first woman to land on the moon.,
260,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,- lsn't the opera romantic?,
261,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- Even more so with a man.,

275,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"I knew it was rude and over-dramatic, but I felt like I'd just seen the phantom of the opera.",
276,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yes, ditching Charlotte was slightly hysterical, but the idea of sitting across from Big and Natasha through the second act of ""Aida"" was too emotional to bear.",
277,3.0,7.0,Carrie,This time I knew what was wrong.,
278,3.0,7.0,Carrie,The shock of seeing Big again not only made my stomach flip it sent my spleen leaping right into my throat.,
279,3.0,7.0,Miranda,- Hello.,
280,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- It's me.,
281,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm really sorry.,

289,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- Yeah.,
290,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm great actually.,
291,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm realizing that maybe there is something to this available man thing.,
292,3.0,7.0,Miranda,Yeah.,
293,3.0,7.0,Miranda,It's kind of nice.,
294,3.0,7.0,Miranda,Just separate your whites.,
295,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Now I know I wanna be with a man who wants to be with me.,
296,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I've had enough relationship drama for one lifetime.,
297,3.0,7.0,Miranda,Shouldn't you be telling this to Aidan?,
298,3.0,7.0,Carrie,It's 3:00 am.,
299,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'll wait until a more civilized hour.,
300,3.0,7.0,Carrie,The next morning I waited until a decent hour to call Aidan and tell him how much I missed him.,

307,3.0,7.0,Carrie,- Thanks.,
308,3.0,7.0,Receptionist,- Bye.,
309,3.0,7.0,Carrie,When I hadn't heard from him by that evening I began to get butterflies in my stomach.,

311,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Hey.,
312,3.0,7.0,Carrie,It's Carrie.,

314,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm just calling to say hey.,
315,3.0,7.0,Carrie,Hey.,
316,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I was getting a dreaded feeling that I had played this all wrong.,

318,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Miranda was trying not to breathe near Steve's shorts.",
319,3.0,7.0,Miranda,What are you doing?,
320,3.0,7.0,Steve,I thought you might need some help with the wash.,
321,3.0,7.0,Carrie,But there's nothing like a twist in the third act to spice up even the most banal scenario.,
322,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"And while Miranda and Steve found new life in the familiar, Charlotte was blindly feeling her way through the unfamiliar.",
323,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Excuse me.,
324,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,Are you Phil? Sorry.,

332,3.0,7.0,Dennis,"Charlotte, Phil's not coming I never called Phil.",
333,3.0,7.0,Dennis,I didn't want you to meet him.,
334,3.0,7.0,Dennis,You'd like him and that could be a problem.,
335,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,- What are you talking about? ,
336,3.0,7.0,Dennis,"- I'm in love with you, Charlotte.",
337,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,You can't be in love with me - you're married to my friend.,
338,3.0,7.0,Dennis,"Things haven't been great with us, and I can't stop thinking about you.",
339,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,- This is nuts.,
340,3.0,7.0,Dennis,- Don't leave.,
341,3.0,7.0,Charlotte,You kept your single friends away from me so you could cheat? - You should be ashamed of yourself.,
342,3.0,7.0,Dennis,- You're such a spark plug.,
343,3.0,7.0,Dennis,I love that.,

374,3.0,7.0,Carrie,"I've called and you haven't called me, so then I thought I'm just gonna go, because being in a relationship means taking a riska leap of faith.",
375,3.0,7.0,Carrie,No matter how many times one might have been disappointed before.,
376,3.0,7.0,Carrie,I said to myself I'm just gonna show upbecause you're a good man.,

113,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Look at you.,

117,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"- Yeah, right.",
118,3.0,8.0,Steve,I'm serious.,
119,3.0,8.0,Steve,"We'd have a cute baby, not one that looks like Khrushchev.",
120,3.0,8.0,Steve,- We wouldn't have to get married.,
121,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- You're serious?,
122,3.0,8.0,Steve,Yes.,
123,3.0,8.0,Steve,The timing is perfect.,
124,3.0,8.0,Miranda,The timing is not perfect.,
125,3.0,8.0,Miranda,We've only been living together for two months.,
126,3.0,8.0,Miranda,It's way too quick.,
127,3.0,8.0,Miranda,We cannot have a baby.,
128,3.0,8.0,Miranda,You're insane.,
129,3.0,8.0,Steve,Come on.,
130,3.0,8.0,Steve,I want a baby.,
131,3.0,8.0,Steve,It'd be fun.,
132,3.0,8.0,Miranda,It's not like owning a foosball table.,

134,3.0,8.0,Steve,"Yeah, I know.",
135,3.0,8.0,Steve,But I can hang out with him during the day.,
136,3.0,8.0,Steve,"Watch ""Sesame Street"" while you're at work, then I go to work at the bar.",
137,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"And I'd be up all night with the baby, alone and getting no sleep, then have to get up the next day and work 14 hours to make partner so I can afford the apartment you're watching ""Sesame Street"" in.",
138,3.0,8.0,Steve,Let's hope the baby inherits my positive attitude.,
139,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Can we please talk about something else? ,
140,3.0,8.0,Steve,No problem.,
141,3.0,8.0,Carrie,While Miranda was left contemplating diapers I was contemplating McQueen versus Gucci.,
142,3.0,8.0,Carrie,It's your last chance to attend a fabulous party with a fabulous girl.,
143,3.0,8.0,Aidan,- It's a party on a boat? ,

149,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"- No, I want the celebrity sightings.",
150,3.0,8.0,Aidan,I'd be stuck on this boat with all these celebs.,
151,3.0,8.0,Carrie,And celebrity hangers-on.,
152,3.0,8.0,Aidan,"It's tempting, but is it OK if I stay on dry land?",
153,3.0,8.0,Carrie,- Of course.,
154,3.0,8.0,Aidan,- Will you still be easy later?,
155,3.0,8.0,Carrie,- Is that a proposition? ,
156,3.0,8.0,Aidan,- Bon voyage.,

158,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"The ""Gab"" party was everything they promised and more.",

162,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, Trey was doing most of the gabbing.",
163,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,- The part about the birthday present.,
164,3.0,8.0,Trey,- That's right.,
165,3.0,8.0,Trey,My mother gives me this awful machine for sorting change,
166,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,He has a lot of change.,
167,3.0,8.0,Trey,for my birthday.,
168,3.0,8.0,Trey,I lied to her and said I loved it.,
169,3.0,8.0,Trey,I jumped into a cab and drove that thing right back.,
170,3.0,8.0,Trey,"So there I was, on ",
171,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,40th & Broadway,
172,3.0,8.0,Trey,"Right, 40th and Broadway",
173,3.0,8.0,Trey,- I hear a woman yell like a hyena.,
174,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,- I did not! The cab stops.,
175,3.0,8.0,Trey,I almost hit my head on that plastic partition.,
176,3.0,8.0,Trey,I got out ,
177,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,He told him to stop the meter.,
178,3.0,8.0,Trey,"And there was Charlotte, lying on the street.",
179,3.0,8.0,Trey,That's how we met.,
180,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,And that's how we met.,
181,3.0,8.0,Carrie,- That's very sweet.,

183,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"- It's OK, cos I remember.",
184,3.0,8.0,Trey,"- Anyway, it was fate.",
185,3.0,8.0,Trey,If my mother didn't give me bad gifts this wonderful gift would never have come into my life.,
186,3.0,8.0,Carrie,I'd heard the story at least three times.,
187,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Another minute of Trey and we would be in a man overboard situation.,
188,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"- Hey, I'm gonna go to hit the buffet.",
189,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,- OK.,
190,3.0,8.0,Trey,Not too hard.,
191,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"As I walked away, I realised I hadn't seen Charlotte that happy in years and with a man she had known for five minutes.",
192,3.0,8.0,Carrie,And just when I thought I was safe ,

251,3.0,8.0,Carrie,He's home.,
252,3.0,8.0,Carrie,I didn't wanna subject him to the slimy media leeches.,
253,3.0,8.0,Big,Good idea.,
254,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Present company excluded.,
255,3.0,8.0,Big,"- That's some outfit, kid.",
256,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"- Really? Do you think so? If you like this, you'll love the one being held hostage on 74th and Lex.",
257,3.0,8.0,Carrie,It's good to see you.,
258,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"The next morning I recovered from my see-Big sickness, while downtown, Samantha realised maybe her ship had sailed.",
259,3.0,8.0,Carrie,She was five days late.,
260,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Later we did brunch and bathroom at Time Cafe.,
261,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,- I'm in love with him.,
262,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- You're not in love with him.,
263,3.0,8.0,Miranda,You're in love with the expensive watch he gave you.,
264,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- Do you have another?,
265,3.0,8.0,Carrie,- I'm not Tampax central.,
266,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Buy them.,
267,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,I have them at home.,
268,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,But they won't fit in my Kate Spade purse.,
269,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"Wow, Kate must have a tiny vagina.",
270,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,The watch is a sign that he's in love with me too.,
271,3.0,8.0,Samantha,- He's just in blue ball hell.,
272,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,- Sometimes you just know.,
273,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,We're the right match.,
274,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,It's fate.,
275,3.0,8.0,Miranda,It's not fate.,
276,3.0,8.0,Miranda,His light is on.,
277,3.0,8.0,Miranda,That's all.,
278,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,- What light?,
279,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- Men are like cabs.,

282,3.0,8.0,Miranda,The next woman they pick up is the one they'll marry.,

285,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,- I can't believe that love is random.,
286,3.0,8.0,Miranda,You gotta get them when their light's on.,
287,3.0,8.0,Carrie,- Men I meet are flashing yellows.,
288,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- Or off duty.,
289,3.0,8.0,Miranda,They can drive around for years and not be available.,
290,3.0,8.0,Carrie,They shouldn't be allowed to get behind the wheel!,
291,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Most men don't stay lit long before they take the plunge versus most women who have been lit pretty much since birth.,
292,3.0,8.0,Carrie,That was my last tampon.,
293,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Are you packing?,
294,3.0,8.0,Samantha,"No, I don't have a tampon and probably will never need one again.",
295,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"- A ""no"" is good enough.",
296,3.0,8.0,Samantha,- I haven't had my period in 35 days.,

299,3.0,8.0,Samantha,I'm - I'm drying up.,
300,3.0,8.0,Carrie,- Come on.,
301,3.0,8.0,Carrie,You're overreacting.,
302,3.0,8.0,Carrie,- It was a stupid catalogue.,
303,3.0,8.0,Samantha,- I'm day-old bread.,
304,3.0,8.0,Samantha,My time is up.,
305,3.0,8.0,Samantha,Enjoy your flows.,
306,3.0,8.0,Miranda,For someone with no period you've got a mean case of PMS.,
307,3.0,8.0,Samantha,You have years of miserable cramps ahead of you.,
308,3.0,8.0,Samantha,Ladies What I'm about to tell you may come as a shock.,
309,3.0,8.0,Samantha,I'm a little older than you.,
310,3.0,8.0,Carrie,That night I couldn't stop thinking about time.,
311,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"Was every second of our lives controlled by fate? Or is life a series of random occurrences? If I wasn't always ten minutes late, would my life be totally different? Would I never run into Big? Would there ever be a good time to see him? Was Miranda right? Is timing everything? ",
312,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Could you turn that down? I'm working.,
313,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"OK, not low enough.",
314,3.0,8.0,Steve,You're gonna have to get used to the noise with a baby around.,
315,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Look.,
316,3.0,8.0,Miranda,I've been thinking about this baby thing.,
317,3.0,8.0,Miranda,We're not in a great place right now.,
318,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"Can we have this conversation without ""Scooby Doo""? ",
319,3.0,8.0,Steve,It's the one where they find the ghost in the salt mine.,
320,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- I'm serious.,
321,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Turn off the cartoons.,
322,3.0,8.0,Steve,- But what about the ghost?,
323,3.0,8.0,Miranda, - You knowwhat? Forget it.,
324,3.0,8.0,Steve,- Miranda.,
325,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Then Miranda realised she may have already had a baby in her house.,
326,3.0,8.0,Miranda,I wanna shelve this baby thing for a while.,
327,3.0,8.0,Steve,"OK, you got it.",
328,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Put a coaster under that glass and turn off the lights before you come to bed.,
329,3.0,8.0,Miranda,We haven't had sex in over a week and he wants a baby.,
330,3.0,8.0,Miranda,What's wrong with this picture?,
331,3.0,8.0,Carrie,You can always go the lmmaculate Conception route.,
332,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"Seriously, we're in this shitty place.",
333,3.0,8.0,Miranda,We fight and I'm working long hours for this partner thing.,
334,3.0,8.0,Miranda,And he's using a baby as a Band-Aid for everything that's wrong with us.,
335,3.0,8.0,Carrie,- What is wrong with you guys?,
336,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- I don't know.,
337,3.0,8.0,Miranda,It's like he's a kid and I end up nagging him all the time.,
338,3.0,8.0,Miranda,I'm mean mommy and no one wants to fuck mean mommy.,
339,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"Oh, I believe you.",
340,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Maybe I'm sabotaging the relationship so I don't have to actually be happy.,
341,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Maybe the problem is me.,
342,3.0,8.0,Carrie,This baby is gonna need a lot of therapy.,
343,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- There is no baby! ,
344,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"- OK, mean mommy.",
345,3.0,8.0,Miranda,But I do want one eventually and my clock is running out.,
346,3.0,8.0,Miranda,I've only got a million viable eggs left.,
347,3.0,8.0,Carrie,with those martinis at lunch.,
348,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"That night, Samantha got drunk.",
349,3.0,8.0,Carrie,She had lost her spirit and no pill in the catalogue could correct that.,
350,3.0,8.0,Carrie,And so she accepted a date with Len.,
351,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"After all, day-old bread needed to stick together.",
352,3.0,8.0,Len,- Ever been in a Cadillac Eldorado? ,
353,3.0,8.0,Samantha,- No.,
354,3.0,8.0,Len,"Oh, those babies are smooth.",
355,3.0,8.0,Len,They have buttons for everything.,
356,3.0,8.0,Len,There's even a button to adjust your lumbar.,
357,3.0,8.0,Len,Great for my hip.,
358,3.0,8.0,Len,Did I tell you I have an artificial hip?,
359,3.0,8.0,Samantha,- No.,
360,3.0,8.0,Len,"- Hard to believe, baby? ",
361,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Samantha couldn't listen to one more minute of Len,
362,3.0,8.0,Carrie,So she slept with him and his hip to shut him up.,
363,3.0,8.0,Len,"Yeah, baby.",
364,3.0,8.0,Len,Give it to daddy.,
365,3.0,8.0,Len,"- Oh, Jesus.",
366,3.0,8.0,Samantha,- What.,
367,3.0,8.0,Len,"Baby, either you're a virgin or flow just came to town.",
368,3.0,8.0,Samantha,- My period?,
369,3.0,8.0,Len,- There's blood everywhere.,
370,3.0,8.0,Samantha,"Oh, my God.",
371,3.0,8.0,Samantha,That is so ,
372,3.0,8.0,Len,These sheets are two grand a set.,
373,3.0,8.0,Samantha,"I'm sorry, really very sorry.",
374,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Samantha said sorry.,
375,3.0,8.0,Carrie,What she really meant was there are more young studs in this pre-pre-menopausal woman's future.,
376,3.0,8.0,Samantha,This is embarrassing.,
377,3.0,8.0,Samantha,I should go.,
378,3.0,8.0,Samantha,Thanks for dinner.,
379,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"The next day, Miranda was putting in time and a half at her firm when",
380,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- Miranda Hobbes.,
381,3.0,8.0,Steve,- Hey.,
382,3.0,8.0,Miranda,I'm busy and can't talk.,
383,3.0,8.0,Steve,"Meet me in half an hour at 56th and 3rd, OK? ",
384,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"- I can't, I got a meeting at 4:00.",
385,3.0,8.0,Steve,"- Come on, it will help.",
386,3.0,8.0,Steve,- Please.,
387,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- OK.,
388,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- This is not gonna happen.,
389,3.0,8.0,Steve,- Come on.,
390,3.0,8.0,Steve,Look at them.,
391,3.0,8.0,Miranda,How exactly would this help us?,
392,3.0,8.0,Steve,Maybe we're not ready for a baby.,
393,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- This could be a test run.,
394,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- Who would take care of the test run? ,
395,3.0,8.0,Steve,Me.,
396,3.0,8.0,Steve,"Please, buyer lady.",
397,3.0,8.0,Steve,Take me home and love me.,
398,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- You're insane.,
399,3.0,8.0,Steve,- Not in front of the puppy! .,
400,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Miranda had been backed into a corner,
401,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"Even though she was surrounded by bitches, she didn't wanna be one.",
402,3.0,8.0,Miranda,OK.,
403,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Charlotte and Trey were performing their usual duet.,
404,3.0,8.0,Trey,and then I got out and found you.,
405,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Oh, really? I found you.",
406,3.0,8.0,Trey,- I think I should come in.,
407,3.0,8.0,Charlotte,"- No, sweetie.",

421,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Trey got a hand job.,
422,3.0,8.0,Carrie,And at 3:00 am Miranda was getting nothing but aggravated.,
423,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"Please, go to sleep.",
424,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"Please, I beg you.",
425,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Here.,
426,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Look.,
427,3.0,8.0,Miranda,This is supposed to be your mom's heart beating orsomething.,

430,3.0,8.0,Miranda,We get this puppy.,
431,3.0,8.0,Miranda,I'm the only one taking care of it.,
432,3.0,8.0,Miranda,I've been up all night.,
433,3.0,8.0,Miranda,You're asleep.,
434,3.0,8.0,Miranda,This was a huge mistake.,
435,3.0,8.0,Steve,"Come on, relax.",
436,3.0,8.0,Steve,It will be fine.,
437,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"For you, because you're not doing anything.",
438,3.0,8.0,Steve,He's just getting used to us.,
439,3.0,8.0,Steve,"Poochie, poochie, puppy boy.",
440,3.0,8.0,Steve,Give mommy a kiss.,
441,3.0,8.0,Miranda,This is it.,
442,3.0,8.0,Miranda,I'm so sick of you being the kid here.,
443,3.0,8.0,Miranda,I cannot be in charge all the time.,
444,3.0,8.0,Miranda,We're supposed to be equals.,
445,3.0,8.0,Miranda,You think we can have a baby? We can't even have a puppy together.,
446,3.0,8.0,Steve,- We're going through a rough patch.,
447,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- This isn't a patch.,
448,3.0,8.0,Miranda,This is it.,
449,3.0,8.0,Miranda,All the time.,
450,3.0,8.0,Miranda,And it's not good.,
451,3.0,8.0,Steve,Great.,
452,3.0,8.0,Steve,"So you're just gonna give up on us, just like that?",
453,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Not just like that.,
454,3.0,8.0,Miranda,I have been trying not to give up on us for a long time.,
455,3.0,8.0,Steve,- That's nice.,
456,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- I'm just being honest.,
457,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Then Miranda realised something.,
458,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"All this time, she thought the problem was her.",
459,3.0,8.0,Carrie,It wasn't.,
460,3.0,8.0,Carrie,It was them.,
461,3.0,8.0,Carrie,And there was never a good time to say what she had to say.,
462,3.0,8.0,Miranda,"- This isn't gonna work, Steve.",
463,3.0,8.0,Steve,"- There's good stuff, here.",
464,3.0,8.0,Miranda,Not enough.,
465,3.0,8.0,Miranda,A baby would've been a quick fix for something that can't be fixed.,
466,3.0,8.0,Steve,- Because you don't want it to work.,
467,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- That's so unfair.,
468,3.0,8.0,Steve,- I don't wanna fight you anymore.,
469,3.0,8.0,Miranda,- Do you think I do?,

475,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, I was still enjoying my one.",
476,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Do you wanna have a sleepover?,
477,3.0,8.0,Aidan,Let me set the timer.,
478,3.0,8.0,Carrie,I didn't know about Aidan but my light was definitely on.,

482,3.0,8.0,Carrie,I couldn't stop Big coming back into my life.,
483,3.0,8.0,Carrie,But I could stop him from coming out of my machine.,
484,3.0,8.0,Aidan,"Hey, you're out of filters.",
485,3.0,8.0,Aidan,I'm gonna run down to the Korean.,
486,3.0,8.0,Aidan,- Hey ,

500,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"No, go home to your wife.",
501,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Go.,
502,3.0,8.0,Big,I'm so fucked up.,
503,3.0,8.0,Carrie,I had no idea what else Big was gonna say.,
504,3.0,8.0,Carrie,And I'm not sure what bugged me more.,
505,3.0,8.0,Carrie,That I didn't know or that I cared.,
506,3.0,8.0,Big,"Hey, Carrie.",
507,3.0,8.0,Big,I'm here on your corner.,
508,3.0,8.0,Big,I knowyou're home.,

516,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"I should have been happy, but I wasn't.",
517,3.0,8.0,Carrie,It was the absolute worst timing of all.,
518,3.0,8.0,Carrie,"Ten minutes later, Aidan still hadn't come back.",
519,3.0,8.0,Carrie,Suddenly my life was all about timing.,
520,3.0,8.0,Carrie,All the right things said at all the wrong times.,
521,3.0,8.0,Carrie,My past coming back way too fast.,
522,3.0,8.0,Carrie,And my future taking way too long to come home.,
0,3.0,9.0,Miranda,"OK, I gotta go.",

2,3.0,9.0,Miranda,Give me a kiss.,
3,3.0,9.0,Miranda,Bye-bye.,

12,3.0,9.0,Miranda,"I got a brief due, so",
13,3.0,9.0,Carrie,There was nothing brief about it.,
14,3.0,9.0,Carrie,Steve and Miranda had been doing the polite avoid-each-other break-up-dance for three weeks.,
15,3.0,9.0,Steve,I'm sorry it's taking me so long to find a place.,

23,3.0,9.0,Miranda,We could do that.,

133,3.0,10.0,Trey,Feel free to have your lawyer look it over.,

135,3.0,10.0,Miranda,This looks normal.,

137,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,"We're not married yet, and already we're talking about divorce.",
138,3.0,10.0,Carrie,A lot of people do prenups.,

141,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,- That is so unromantic.,
142,3.0,10.0,Miranda,And necessary.,
143,3.0,10.0,Miranda,50 per cent of marriages end in divorce.,
144,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,There it is again - divorce.,
145,3.0,10.0,Miranda,"I'm sure you'll live happily ever after, but I wouldn't marry without this.",
146,3.0,10.0,Carrie,I'm safe.,
147,3.0,10.0,Carrie,What's he gonna take from me - shoes? Maybe I do need one.,
148,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,What? ,
149,3.0,10.0,Miranda,This is unusual.,
150,3.0,10.0,Miranda,He has you on a vesting schedule.,
151,3.0,10.0,Miranda,"For every five years you're married, you get a percentage of $500,000.",
152,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,"I'm only worth $500,000.",
153,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- Over 30 years.,
154,3.0,10.0,Carrie,- Maybe that's your wholesale price.,
155,3.0,10.0,Miranda,"If you have any boys, you'll get another 100 grand.",
156,3.0,10.0,Carrie,How much for girls?,
157,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- Nada.,
158,3.0,10.0,Carrie,- That's bad business.,
159,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,I can't sign that.,
160,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,I can't marry someone knowing they feel this way.,
161,3.0,10.0,Miranda,This is just their opening offer.,
162,3.0,10.0,Miranda,It's standard to negotiate.,
163,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,I can't even buy stuff on sale.,
164,3.0,10.0,Miranda,Talk to Trey.,
165,3.0,10.0,Miranda,I'm sure his lawyers will take care of this.,
166,3.0,10.0,George,Working over lunch? The New York office is tougher than ours.,
167,3.0,10.0,Miranda,"George, this is Carrie and Charlotte.",
168,3.0,10.0,Miranda,George works in our Chicago office.,x
169,3.0,10.0,George,I'm taking depositions and restaurant recommendations from hip and trendy New Yorkers.,

171,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- George is from Chicago.,
172,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- So it's good?,
173,3.0,10.0,George,- It's fantastic.,
174,3.0,10.0,George,I hope the place tomorrow lives up to your standards.,
175,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- I'm sure it will be great.,
176,3.0,10.0,George,- I'll drop by your office later.,
177,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- OK.,
178,3.0,10.0,George,"- Nice meeting you, ladies.",
179,3.0,10.0,Carrie and Charlotte,Bye.,
180,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"Well, well, well, they sure grow 'em cute in the Midwest.",
181,3.0,10.0,Miranda,I know.,
182,3.0,10.0,Miranda,We have a date.,
183,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,Find out how much he pays for boys before you get attached.,
184,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"and two pages of her black book later, Samantha was no closer to closing her deal.",
185,3.0,10.0,Samantha,Why don't you go fuck yourself.,
186,3.0,10.0,Samantha,I won't be doing it againever.,
187,3.0,10.0,Carrie,Samantha was discovering it was easier to find a guy to screw her than one who'd screw in her curtain rod.,
188,3.0,10.0,Carrie,She wasn't the only one who needed a fix.,
189,3.0,10.0,Carrie,I did everything I could to keep busy until Aidan came back.,
190,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"I re-arranged my sweaters, defrosted my fridge broke into my emergency hidden stash, and thought about choices.",
191,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"Modern women have been told that we can be anything we want - an astronaut, the head of an lnternet company, a stay-at-home mom.",
192,3.0,10.0,Carrie,There aren't any rules.,
193,3.0,10.0,Carrie,Choices are endless.,
194,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"And apparently, they can all be delivered to your door.",
195,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"Is it possible that we've gotten so spoiled by choices that we've become unable to make one? That we know that once you choose something, one man, one great apartment, one amazing job, another option goes away? Are we a generation who can't choose just one from column 'A'? Did we have too much to handle, or was Samantha right? Can we have it all? Two hours later, I had filed every article I'd ever written, but I couldn't file away what had happened with Big.",
196,3.0,10.0,Carrie,I made a choice.,
197,3.0,10.0,Carrie,I called him.,
198,3.0,10.0,Big,- Yeah? ,
199,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"- It's me, Carrie.",
200,3.0,10.0,Big,"Jesus, Carrie.",
201,3.0,10.0,Big,How are you?,
202,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"I'm good, fine.",
203,3.0,10.0,Carrie,OK.,
204,3.0,10.0,Carrie,We need to talk about what happened.,
205,3.0,10.0,Big,- Right now? ,
206,3.0,10.0,Carrie,- Yes.,
207,3.0,10.0,Carrie,Rationally and right now.,
208,3.0,10.0,Big,- Apparently you're the boss.,
209,3.0,10.0,Carrie,- It was just a physical thing.,
210,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"We gave in to our baser instincts, shit happens, blah blah blah.",
211,3.0,10.0,Big,- Are you wearing glasses?,
212,3.0,10.0,Carrie,- No.,
213,3.0,10.0,Big,- You sound like you are.,
214,3.0,10.0,Carrie,- It can't happen.,
215,3.0,10.0,Carrie,You're married.,
216,3.0,10.0,Big,I'm aware of that.,
217,3.0,10.0,Big,"But it was pretty fucking amazing, wasn't it? ",
218,3.0,10.0,Carrie,That is so not the point.,
219,3.0,10.0,Carrie,We're intelligent beings.,
220,3.0,10.0,Carrie,We have to learn to rise above the physical stuff.,
221,3.0,10.0,Big,You can learn to do that? ,
222,3.0,10.0,Carrie,Apparently we couldn't.,
223,3.0,10.0,Big,Next time we're going to a hotel.,
224,3.0,10.0,Big,I can smell the guy on your sheets.,
225,3.0,10.0,Big,Woodchips and Paco Rabanne.,
226,3.0,10.0,Carrie,He doesn't wear cologne.,
227,3.0,10.0,Big,Maybe he should.,
228,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"By the way, there will be no next time.",
229,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"This is gonna be like ""The Bridges Of Madison Avenue"".",
230,3.0,10.0,Carrie,A brief affair I'll write about to my grandchildren.,
231,3.0,10.0,Big,Can I have a beard in the book version? I've always wanted a beard.,
232,3.0,10.0,Carrie,Maybe a goatee.,
233,3.0,10.0,Carrie,It all felt so easy and so good.,
234,3.0,10.0,Carrie,I was like the moth to the old flame.,
235,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile that night, Miranda was enjoying her new flame.",
236,3.0,10.0,George,Can't believe I have to catch an 1 1 o' clock flight.,
237,3.0,10.0,Miranda,But it was fun.,
238,3.0,10.0,George,"If I weren't going back to Chicago, I would try to sleep with you now.",
239,3.0,10.0,Miranda,I'm drunk enough.,
240,3.0,10.0,Miranda,I might have let you.,
241,3.0,10.0,George,Damn! ,
242,3.0,10.0,George,- I have to wait till next time.,
243,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- There will be a next time? ,
244,3.0,10.0,George,Of course.,
245,3.0,10.0,George,I come back and forth a lot.,
246,3.0,10.0,George,"In the meantime, there's always the phone.",
247,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- I have one of those.,
248,3.0,10.0,George,- I'll call you tomorrow night.,
249,3.0,10.0,George,Damn.,
250,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"The next night, Miranda was surprised to hear from George.",
251,3.0,10.0,George,I knew you were a middle child.,
252,3.0,10.0,George,I love it when I'm right.,
253,3.0,10.0,Miranda,"Yeah, spoken like a true only child.",
254,3.0,10.0,Carrie,They talked for two hours about everything.,
255,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"Favorite foods, families It was one of the best dates Miranda had had.",
256,3.0,10.0,George,- What are you wearing? ,
257,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- Then the date got even better.,
258,3.0,10.0,Miranda,Nothing.,
259,3.0,10.0,George,- Wish I were there.,
260,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- Really? ,
261,3.0,10.0,Miranda,What would you do?,
262,3.0,10.0,George,I would start by kissing your neck,
263,3.0,10.0,George,Slowly.,
264,3.0,10.0,George,"Then I'd work my way down, start licking your nipples - ",
265,3.0,10.0,George,Where's your hand?,
266,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- On your dick.,
267,3.0,10.0,George,Put the other one on you.,
268,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"That night, Miranda started sleeping with George regularly.",
269,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"She had it all - her own life, and a great boyfriend she could count on.",
270,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"He always called, and she always came to the phone.",
271,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"While Miranda came, I was busy preparing for Aidan to come back.",
272,3.0,10.0,Carrie,I had slept in Big's and my sex-sheets for two days.,
273,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"Like any good junky, I knew how to hide the evidence.",

277,3.0,10.0,Aidan,Look at you.,
278,3.0,10.0,Carrie,I was sure he saw the scarlet 'A' on my chest.,

323,3.0,10.0,Samantha,Give me my drink.,
324,3.0,10.0,Carrie,A frosted martini glass would make that more appetizing.,
325,3.0,10.0,Carrie,Why don't you ask the super to fix your window? .,
326,3.0,10.0,Samantha,I don't have one,
327,3.0,10.0,Samantha,"I own this place, remember? I should have got married.",
328,3.0,10.0,Samantha,Then at least I'd have a curtain that closes.,
329,3.0,10.0,Samantha,"Oh, Carrie, it doesn't matter how much you have.",
330,3.0,10.0,Samantha,"If you don't have a guy who cares about you, - it all means shit.",

334,3.0,10.0,Samantha,I'm gonna tell you something.,
335,3.0,10.0,Samantha,"There's two types of guys out there - the ones that hold your hand, and the ones that fuck you.",
336,3.0,10.0,Carrie,I'd slept with both of them in the last 48 hours.,
337,3.0,10.0,Samantha,The guys that fuck you aren't worth a damn.,
338,3.0,10.0,Samantha,We're all alone.,
339,3.0,10.0,Carrie,We are not alone.,
340,3.0,10.0,Carrie,We have each other.,

346,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"- Look, headbands are back.",
347,3.0,10.0,Samantha,- Where's the food? ,
348,3.0,10.0,Carrie,Amazing what days of a cough syrup and Fanta diet will do for the appetite.,
349,3.0,10.0,Miranda,They're WASPs.,
350,3.0,10.0,Miranda,"There's never food, only booze.",
351,3.0,10.0,Samantha,Fine.,
352,3.0,10.0,Samantha,"One martini, six olives.",

354,3.0,10.0,Miranda,Look at these people.,
355,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- They're like Ken and Barbie cut-outs.,
356,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,- You made it.,
357,3.0,10.0,Trey,- I see you found the bar.,
358,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- We're good that way.,
359,3.0,10.0,Bunny,"Trey, you have to keep people out of the maid's room.",
360,3.0,10.0,Bunny,There are photos of me rowing college crew in there.,
361,3.0,10.0,Bunny,It's mortifying.,
362,3.0,10.0,Trey,These are Charlotte's friends.,

364,3.0,10.0,Bunny,Pleasure to have you.,
365,3.0,10.0,Bunny,There's Reverend Williams.,
366,3.0,10.0,Bunny,Maybe we should say hello before he gets into the Scotch.,
367,3.0,10.0,Trey,It's about 20 years too late for that.,
368,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,- I haven't signed the prenup.,

370,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,I don't know.,
371,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,I'm confused.,
372,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,"I love him, but I feel like no one cares about me.",
373,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,"I thought if we could negotiate, it'd be OK, but now it all feels wrong.",
374,3.0,10.0,Miranda,- What does Trey say? ,
375,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,- Nothing.,
376,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,He leaves it to his mother.,
377,3.0,10.0,Samantha,You can take her.,
378,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,- What should I do? ,
379,3.0,10.0,Carrie,- We can't tell you what to do.,
380,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"I wasn't one to talk about marriage, considering I might break one up.",
381,3.0,10.0,Miranda,You have to do what feels right to you.,
382,3.0,10.0,Carrie,It depends how much you want to marry Trey.,
383,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,"- Bunny, do you have a minute?",
384,3.0,10.0,Bunny,- Of course.,
385,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"Charlotte realized, if she wanted to close the deal with Trey, she'd have to close the deal with Bunny first.",
386,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,- I haven't signed the prenup.,
387,3.0,10.0,Bunny,- You've been busy.,
388,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,I have a little problem with how much I'm worth.,
389,3.0,10.0,Bunny,I see.,
390,3.0,10.0,Bunny,That is the standard amount.,
391,3.0,10.0,Bunny,It's how it's always been done in the MacDougal family.,
392,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,Right.,
393,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"Not only would she have to negotiate, she'd have to play hardball.",
394,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,"Well, you know we haven't finalized the wedding arrangements.",
395,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,Trey would be disappointed if I backed out.,
396,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,"""The Times"" announcement would run, there would be questions",
397,3.0,10.0,Bunny,- What do you want?,
398,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,- I'm worth a million.,
399,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,I did it.,
400,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,"I negotiated with Bunny, and I signed the prenup.",
401,3.0,10.0,Carrie,That's great.,
402,3.0,10.0,Charlotte,- I'm getting married.,

406,3.0,10.0,Miranda,She's all yours.,
407,3.0,10.0,Carrie,It was then that we realized that we didn't have it all.,
408,3.0,10.0,Carrie,We no longer had Charlotte.,
409,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"Then, there were three.",
410,3.0,10.0,Samantha,I can't believe she's marrying that guy.,
411,3.0,10.0,Miranda,For a tenth of what she's worth.,
412,3.0,10.0,Carrie,I thought you were Ms Pro Marriage now.,
413,3.0,10.0,Samantha,I was delirious.,
414,3.0,10.0,Samantha,I also saw spots all over my bathtub.,
415,3.0,10.0,Miranda,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but it feels weird without her here.",
416,3.0,10.0,Samantha,That's such a Charlotte thing to say.,
417,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"After a week full of Aidan and no cigarettes, I felt like I had finally kicked my addiction.",

430,3.0,10.0,Carrie,I told Aidan I was taking Pete for a walk.,
431,3.0,10.0,Aidan,"He believed me, which only made it worse.",
432,3.0,10.0,Carrie,Don't ever call me at home again.,
433,3.0,10.0,Carrie,Walk.,
434,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"You can't just decide you wanna see me, and I'm there.",
435,3.0,10.0,Big,- Is this his dog?,

437,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"You want it all - the girl you screw, and the girl you go home to.",
438,3.0,10.0,Big,That's bullshit.,
439,3.0,10.0,Big,I just want you.,
440,3.0,10.0,Big,"I can't do this any more, sleep with two people at the same time.",
441,3.0,10.0,Big,- I'll tell her tonight.,
442,3.0,10.0,Carrie,- What? -,

447,3.0,10.0,Carrie,You have no right to do this.,
448,3.0,10.0,Carrie,You can't come and fuck up my life.,

477,3.0,10.0,George,Oh.,
478,3.0,10.0,Miranda,Are you having phone sex with other people? ,
479,3.0,10.0,George,I don't think we ever said this was an exclusive thing.,
480,3.0,10.0,Miranda,"Oh, my God.",
481,3.0,10.0,Carrie,Miranda stopped being hung up on George.,
482,3.0,10.0,Carrie,So she hung up on him.,
483,3.0,10.0,Carrie,"Three hours later, I hadn't found Pete, and I felt as lost as he was.",

99,3.0,12.0,Miranda,I'd wanna have all the information.,
100,3.0,12.0,Carrie,That might mean more coming from someone not posing as a stewardess.,

153,3.0,17.0,Carrie,"Tell Detective Stevens, if he sees a woman wearing pink suede Blahnik sandals, bring her in for questioning.",
154,3.0,17.0,Carrie,"While I ascribed thoughts of karma to fortune cookie psychology, I wondered, does a string of bad dates equal one good one? And will treating someone badly in one relationship ensure that you'll be treated badly in the next? Does everything that goes around come around? If so, will it come around to bite you in the ass? Is there such a thing as relationship karma? Later, I accompanied Samantha to a party thrown by Sam Jones.",
155,3.0,17.0,Carrie,I can't believe we're going to the party of a total stranger.,
156,3.0,17.0,Samantha,"It's not a total stranger, we do share the same name.",

161,3.0,17.0,Carrie,- How can you tell over the phone?,
162,3.0,17.0,Samantha, - I can.,
163,3.0,17.0,Samantha,"Besides, Washington Square - very money address.",
164,3.0,17.0,Samantha,I feel like there's some cosmic purpose to all this.,
165,3.0,17.0,Samantha,It's too much of a coincidence.,
166,3.0,17.0,Carrie,What was the cosmic purpose of my getting snubbed by Natasha? ,
167,3.0,17.0,Samantha,"If I told you I had information about Big and Natasha, would you consider it cosmic or a random act of gossip?",
168,3.0,17.0,Carrie,I'd have to hear it first.,

170,3.0,17.0,Samantha,It's over.,

177,3.0,17.0,Carrie,I can't believe I'm responsible for breaking up their marriage.,
178,3.0,17.0,Samantha,You're not.,
179,3.0,17.0,Samantha,It probably wouldn't have worked anyway.,
180,3.0,17.0,Carrie,- I don't think I could feel any worse.,
181,3.0,17.0,Samantha,- Here we are.,
182,3.0,17.0,Samantha,- It's a dorm.,
183,3.0,17.0,Carrie,"- Look at that, I feel worse.",
184,3.0,17.0,Samantha,Do you think these cute boys are still in college?,
185,3.0,17.0,Carrie,Yes.,
186,3.0,17.0,Samantha,"I'm going to find Sam Jones, and then we're outta here.",
187,3.0,17.0,Samantha,Excuse me.,
188,3.0,17.0,Samantha,Could you tell me where I can find Sam Jones?,
189,3.0,17.0,Samantha,- Sam Jones? ,
190,3.0,17.0,Sam Jones,- Yeah.,
191,3.0,17.0,Sam Jones,Who are you? ,

193,3.0,17.0,Sam Jones,- Excuse me?,
194,3.0,17.0,Samantha,It appears that we have a problem here.,
195,3.0,17.0,Samantha,"We have the same name, and I'm getting all your fucking calls.",
196,3.0,17.0,Sam Jones,"If you're getting all my ""fucking"" calls, that explains why I'm still a virgin.",
197,3.0,17.0,Carrie,"Samantha wondered what message the universe was sending her, but Miranda had no doubt.",
198,3.0,17.0,Miranda,"This was fun, and I would invite you in, but you've been in, and I have a huge day tomorrow, which isn't to say I wouldn't like to see you again.",
199,3.0,17.0,Detective Stevens,"I would, if you'd like I'll call you.",x
200,3.0,17.0,Carrie,She felt like she had just hit the cosmic jackpot.,
201,3.0,17.0,Carrie,Please don't tell anyone we were here.,
202,3.0,17.0,Samantha,Some of those boys were cute.,
203,3.0,17.0,Carrie,- Some of them were young enough,
204,3.0,17.0,Samantha, - Don't you dare say it.,
205,3.0,17.0,Man,"- Excuse me, ladies.",
206,3.0,17.0,Man,"- Excuse me, Mom.",
207,3.0,17.0,Carrie,"Cab! Natasha fell down the stairs, now I fall down the stairs.",
208,3.0,17.0,Carrie,This is an open and shut case of karmic retribution.,
209,3.0,17.0,Samantha,- It was an accident.,
210,3.0,17.0,Carrie,- This was not an accident.,

143,3.0,18.0,Miranda,"How can they have new relationships? I'm still in the ""l just broke up with someone"" phase.",

176,3.0,18.0,Carrie,"Later that night I got to thinking about men, women and relationships.",
177,3.0,18.0,Carrie,"Or more to the point, how women feel men disappoint them in relationships.",
178,3.0,18.0,Carrie,"Then a radical, earth-shattering thought popped into my head.",
179,3.0,18.0,Carrie,"What if everything isn't the man's fault? After a certain age and a certain number of relationships, if it still isn't working and the ex's seem to be moving on and we don't, perhaps the problem isn't the last boyfriend, or the one before him or even the one before him.",

187,3.0,18.0,Samantha,"And I think we all know, there are certain dark circles even the best make-up can't cover.",
188,3.0,18.0,Samantha,Am I right? ,
189,3.0,18.0,Destiny,"Sorry to wake you, baby.",

14,4.0,2.0,Lynne ,Carrie! ,
15,4.0,2.0,Carrie,Lynne Cameron was a much sought after fashion-show producer as valuable to a show's success as Valium or Velcro.,
16,4.0,2.0,Lynne ,I just told Damian you have just so fucking saved my life.,
17,4.0,2.0,Carrie,- I did? ,
18,4.0,2.0,Lynne ,"- Sorry, this is my boyfriend, Damian.",
19,4.0,2.0,Lynne ,"I use the term ""boyfriend"" loosely, as Damian is clearly a homosexual.",
20,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"In that case, this is my boyfriend, Stanford.",
21,4.0,2.0,Lynne ,You so have to be in this fashion show I'm doing.,

46,4.0,2.0,Samantha,I'm having nude photographs taken on Wednesday.,
47,4.0,2.0,Miranda,What're you gonna do? Have postcards made up to hand out to prospective dates? ,
48,4.0,2.0,Samantha,This is not about a man's approval.,
49,4.0,2.0,Samantha,This photo is just for me.,
50,4.0,2.0,Samantha,"So when I'm old and my tits are in my shoes I can look at it and say, ""Damn, I was hot.",
51,4.0,2.0,Miranda,""" - Isn't that a little narcissistic? ",
52,4.0,2.0,Samantha,- No one thinks that when you get your seventh-grade picture taken.,
53,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,- You weren't naked in that.,
54,4.0,2.0,Carrie,- That we know of.,
55,4.0,2.0,Samantha,"Look, I like my body.",

57,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"No problem, you're my hero.",
58,4.0,2.0,Carrie,I think it's fantastic that you can just put it out there.,
59,4.0,2.0,Carrie,I can't even say yes to being in some charity fashion show.,
60,4.0,2.0,Samantha,"- ""New York Style""? ",

69,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,How many fashion shows did you drag me to during Fashion Week?,
70,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"- Eight, what's your point? ",
71,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,- Why are you turning down - the chance to actually be in one? ,
72,4.0,2.0,Carrie,- I do not belong on a runway.,
73,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"Runways are for models, not writers.",
74,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,What's the difference between strutting down a runway and the way you strut down Fifth Avenue? Strut? ,
75,4.0,2.0,Carrie,- Do I strut? Am I a strutter?,
76,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,- I think it'd be fun.,
77,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,I was a teen model when the Ralph Lauren store opened in New Haven.,

83,4.0,2.0,Carrie,Exactly.,
84,4.0,2.0,Carrie,I don't want people to think that I can't see the difference between a model and me.,
85,4.0,2.0,Samantha,Who gives a fuck what people think? This is a fabulous opportunity.,
86,4.0,2.0,Samantha,Honey.,
87,4.0,2.0,Samantha,- You'll probably get to keep the clothes.,

90,4.0,2.0,Samantha,- So would I.,
91,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"What do you think, mutey? ",

112,4.0,2.0,Miranda,"Smart, yes.",

114,4.0,2.0,Miranda,"Sexy is the thing I try to get them to see me as, after I win them over with my personality.",
115,4.0,2.0,Carrie,You win men over with your personality? ,
116,4.0,2.0,Miranda,They want you to be a model? ,
117,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"Okay, I'm hanging up now.",
118,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"Later that night, I got to thinking about Narcissus.",
119,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"A man so consumed with his own image, he drowned in it.",
120,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"Did he have no best friends to mirror back a healthier view of himself? And why is it that we can see our friends perfectly but when it comes to ourselves, no matter how hard we look do we ever see ourselves clearly? Samantha, on the other hand, saw herself a little too clearly.",
121,4.0,2.0,Photographer,"Okay, Samantha Tiger, here, has a variety of music choices to ease you into the shoot and help you to feel more comfortable.",

144,4.0,2.0,Carrie,Exactly.,
145,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"Charlotte would you say that I'm strutting right now? Charlotte decided for Stanford Blatch, it would have to be someone cute.",

154,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,"I have this friend, Stanford ",
155,4.0,2.0,Anthony,What's he look like? ,
156,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,He is adorable.,
157,4.0,2.0,Anthony,"In a movie, who would play him? ",
158,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,I don't know A younger Ed Harris.,
159,4.0,2.0,Anthony,That's hot.,
160,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"And speaking of hot, Miranda ended her first date with Captain Crunch.",

165,4.0,2.0,Dave,What? You don't think so? ,
166,4.0,2.0,Carrie,Maybe he was right.,
167,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"After all, who was Miranda to argue with the Captain? - Hello? ",
168,4.0,2.0,Lynne,- Miss Motherfucker why have you not returned my last 200 phone calls?,
169,4.0,2.0,Carrie,Lynne.,
170,4.0,2.0,Carrie,I really don't think that I should do this show.,
171,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"I mean, come on, I am not a model.",
172,4.0,2.0,Lynne ,"And as much as I would like to think Carrie, you're in or you're out, I don't have time for this.",
173,4.0,2.0,Lynne,I'm sure Dolce & Gabbana can find someone else to dress.,
174,4.0,2.0,Carrie,Dolce & Gabbana?,
175,4.0,2.0,Lynne,Each designer picks the person they want to dress.,
176,4.0,2.0,Carrie,Dolce & Gabbana picked me? ,

288,4.0,2.0,Samantha,"Oh, my God! Honey, I insist you go home right now and take a look. Or better yet, take my compact and make a quick trip to the ladies' room.",
289,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,I don't want to look.,
290,4.0,2.0,Charlotte,I think it's ugly.,
291,4.0,2.0,Miranda,Maybe that's why it's depressed.,
292,4.0,2.0,Samantha,What did I miss? ,
293,4.0,2.0,Carrie,On their second date Miranda did most of the talking.,

300,4.0,2.0,Samantha,I want pure class.,
301,4.0,2.0,Samantha,I'm thinking ash or a charcoal-gray matte inside the frame.,
302,4.0,2.0,Framer,Inch on either side? ,
303,4.0,2.0,Carrie,Even though Samantha had done the photo just for her she still wanted to be seen a certain way by men.,
304,4.0,2.0,Framer,Charcoal would bring out the gray tones.,
305,4.0,2.0,Samantha,"The matte should stop about an inch away from my breast right here, see my breast? And then stop right around here, near my ass.",
306,4.0,2.0,Samantha,See that? Right near my ass.,
307,4.0,2.0,Framer,How's next Thursday? ,
308,4.0,2.0,Samantha,Whatever.,

315,4.0,2.0,Carrie,"So, you know, it'd be here, then here and sometimes here and here.",
316,4.0,2.0,Carrie,Here's another one.,

1,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"I was on my second date with Ray King, who lived in Queens but it felt like our second, third and fourth date because we'd been to three jazz clubs in one night.",
2,4.0,4.0,Ray,"I can't sing for shit, but damn, can I chop.",
3,4.0,4.0,Carrie,And where does one learn this skill? ,
4,4.0,4.0,Ray,- Jersey Shore.,
5,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- Is that where you're from?,
6,4.0,4.0,Ray, Listen.,
7,4.0,4.0,Ray,This lick right here is why I wanted to play the bass.,
8,4.0,4.0,Ray,Man.,
9,4.0,4.0,Ray,"How about that? Jesus, that's sweet.",
10,4.0,4.0,Ray,Listen to that again.,
11,4.0,4.0,Ray,How about that? ,
12,4.0,4.0,Carrie,This might be a good time to tell you I don't like jazz.,
13,4.0,4.0,Ray,Why would you say something like that? ,
14,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"I don't know, you can't follow it and there's no melody.",
15,4.0,4.0,Carrie,And it's just like It's all over the place.,
16,4.0,4.0,Ray,"Carrie, you gotta stop trying to make it be something else and appreciate it for what it is.",
17,4.0,4.0,Ray,"Damn, I wish I had my bass.",
18,4.0,4.0,Ray,"Come here, you be the bass.",
19,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Don't I have to be in the musician's union or something? You play all those instruments? ,
20,4.0,4.0,Ray,"""Play"" is a little strong.",
21,4.0,4.0,Ray,"I learn a few notes, I get bored, I move on.",
22,4.0,4.0,Ray,Listen to the bass.,
23,4.0,4.0,Ray,The beauty of jazz is that it can go anywhere.,
24,4.0,4.0,Ray,It can go from here to here to here ,
25,4.0,4.0,Carrie,It was right about that time that I started to appreciate a little type of music we call jazz.,
26,4.0,4.0,Miranda,So what did you do last night?,
27,4.0,4.0,Carrie,I listened to jazz.,
28,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,What is so funny about jazz? ,
29,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Okay, here it is.",
30,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Last night, with Ray I had the most intense orgasm of my entire life.",
31,4.0,4.0,Miranda,I did my laundry.,

34,4.0,4.0,Carrie,We've only been on two dates.,
35,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,And yet you had sex with him.,
36,4.0,4.0,Samantha,Can everyone please let Carrie talk about the sex? ,
37,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"The mind-blowing sex. Now I realize that this next statement makes me a bit of a freak, but I usually have to be in love with someone to have that kind of orgasm.",
38,4.0,4.0,Samantha,- You might want to see someone about that.,
39,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- What the hell is going on? ,
40,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,Maybe Ray is the one.,
41,4.0,4.0,Samantha,Your clitoris seems to think so.,
42,4.0,4.0,Carrie,It was probably just a fluke.,
43,4.0,4.0,Carrie,I'm going back tomorrow to find out.,
44,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"I, on the other hand, am on strike.",
45,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,What does that mean? ,
46,4.0,4.0,Miranda,It means I'm not having any more sex.,
47,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"That's not a strike, honey, that's a slump.",
48,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"No, it might have started as a slump, but I'm in control of it now.",
49,4.0,4.0,Miranda,I've made the conscious decision not to have sex until conditions improve.,
50,4.0,4.0,Carrie,How many people will be affected by this strike? ,
51,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"So far, just the one, but I'm optimistic.",

53,4.0,4.0,Miranda,I would rather be home alone than out with some guy who sells socks on the Internet.,
54,4.0,4.0,Samantha,I'm dating someone.,
55,4.0,4.0,Samantha,Someone I actually like.,
56,4.0,4.0,Samantha,Maria.,
57,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,"My Maria, from the gallery? ",
58,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"She's my Maria now, we're having a relationship.",
59,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"Yes, ladies, I'm a lesbian.",
60,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Wait a second.,
61,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- You're in a relationship? ,
62,4.0,4.0,Samantha,- Yes.,

70,4.0,4.0,Maria,I see you told them.,
71,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"How does that work? You go to bed, you wake up the next morning and you're a lesbian? ",
72,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"- I forgot to tell you, I'm a fire hydrant.",
73,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- I'm a shoe.,
74,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"I always wanted to be one, and now I am.",
75,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,"I don't think she's a lesbian, I think she just ran out of men.",
76,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"Then you go on strike, you don't eat pussy.",
77,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Did you just say ""eat pussy""?",
78,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"I did, but just for emphasis.",
79,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"You know, the truly amazing thing is, I had the news tonight.",
80,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- I had the most intense ,
81,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"- ""Mind-blowing,"" I believe was the word.",
82,4.0,4.0,Carrie,orgasm of my life and Samantha still managed to up-sex me.,
83,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,They met at my gallery.,
84,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,I introduced them.,
85,4.0,4.0,Carrie,You're a pimp.,
86,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Later that night, inspired by Samantha's willingness to explore new territory Charlotte felt it was time to conquer some old territory.",
87,4.0,4.0,Carrie,The bed where she and Trey had so much trouble as man and wife.,
88,4.0,4.0,Trey,Here we are.,
89,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,Yep.,
90,4.0,4.0,Trey,Should we have a glass of wine first?,
91,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,"- I'm fine, unless you",
92,4.0,4.0,Trey,"- No, I'm okay.",
93,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,If you don't feel ready ,
94,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Just because she was on strike didn't mean she had to do without.,
95,4.0,4.0,Carrie,That's how Miranda discovered the perfect relationship.,
96,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Jon Stewart and chocolate éclairs.,
97,4.0,4.0,Jon Stewart,"be here today and she is, from what I understand, in love with me.",

99,4.0,4.0,Trey,Not bad.,
100,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,It was almost mind-blowing.,
101,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Charlotte was relieved.,
102,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Now that they had fixed their problem in the bedroom she was ready to move back into the other rooms as well.,
103,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,So what are you thinking? ,
104,4.0,4.0,Trey,I'm thinking I've never seen my John Thomas so hard.,
105,4.0,4.0,Trey,"I swear, at times I felt like it was gonna rocket right off.",
106,4.0,4.0,Trey,What were you thinking?,
107,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,I don't know.,
108,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,Should I Do you - Are we ready to ,
109,4.0,4.0,Trey,"- Go again? Houston, we don't have a problem. Three, two, one, blastoff! ",
110,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- Who is it? ,
111,4.0,4.0,Ray,- It's Ray.,
112,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Hi, come on up.",
113,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Shit.,
114,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"So, did you and the girls run down the street talking about me?",
115,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- Maybe.,
116,4.0,4.0,Samantha,- How many blocks? ,

118,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"Honestly, I'm a little hurt.",
119,4.0,4.0,Samantha,After all the hours I've spent listening to you people talk about your relationships.,
120,4.0,4.0,Samantha,You do that? I make the courtesy call.,
121,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"""Do you think you love him? Blah, blah, blah.",
122,4.0,4.0,Carrie,""" You just caught us a little off guard with the lesbian thing.",
123,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"That's just a label, like Gucci or Versace.",
124,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Or Birkenstock.,
125,4.0,4.0,Samantha,This is not about being gay or straight.,
126,4.0,4.0,Samantha,Maria is an incredible woman.,
127,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"She's got passion, and talent - intelligence ",
128,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- A vagina.,

132,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Wow.,
133,4.0,4.0,Carrie,You really are in a relationship.,
134,4.0,4.0,Samantha,I am.,
135,4.0,4.0,Samantha,Life is not all about sex.,
136,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Try telling that to her schmagina.,
137,4.0,4.0,Ray,"I want a bourbon, and I want to go down on you.",
138,4.0,4.0,Ray,Not necessarily in that order.,
139,4.0,4.0,Samantha,The truth is I really want it to be special the first time.,
140,4.0,4.0,Carrie,I'm sure that it will be special.,
141,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"I'm sure it will be special, because ",

143,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"No, Samantha, I'm listening.",
144,4.0,4.0,Carrie,I'm listening.,
145,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"The next day, I thought about what Samantha said.",
146,4.0,4.0,Carrie,She wasn't having sex because she wanted to have a relationship and I was having mind-blowing sex hoping to turn it into a relationship.,
147,4.0,4.0,Carrie,So there you have it.,
148,4.0,4.0,Carrie,We've got a relationship without sex and sex without a relationship.,
149,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Which had a better shot at survival? I couldn't help but wonder, what comes first, the chicken or the sex? That night I decided to really talk to Ray.",
150,4.0,4.0,Carrie,I figured we needed to catch the relationship up to the sex.,
151,4.0,4.0,Carrie,That was the plan.,
152,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Wait a minute.,
153,4.0,4.0,Carrie,I asked you a question.,
154,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Where did you go to school? ,
155,4.0,4.0,Ray,All over. ,
156,4.0,4.0,Ray,"Freckles on the legs, nothing wrong with that.",
157,4.0,4.0,Carrie,It was my best relationship ever.,
158,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, over at Casa de Lesbo ",
159,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"That coq au vin was amazing. You can paint, you can cook, you can do everything.",
160,4.0,4.0,Maria,But you brought the most incredible dessert.,
161,4.0,4.0,Maria,Want a bite? ,
162,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Samantha decided if she was going to be gay she'd be gay all the way.,
163,4.0,4.0,Samantha,I might not be much in the kitchen but I'm more than enough in the bedroom.,
164,4.0,4.0,Samantha,Baby.,
165,4.0,4.0,Maria,Samantha.,
166,4.0,4.0,Maria,It's not really working for me.,
167,4.0,4.0,Carrie,It was a phrase Samantha had never heard in bed before.,
168,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"Honey, I've never gotten any complaints from the men.",
169,4.0,4.0,Maria,Men.,
170,4.0,4.0,Maria,I want you to look at me.,
171,4.0,4.0,Maria,Connect with me.,
172,4.0,4.0,Maria,This is lovemaking.,
173,4.0,4.0,Maria,It's not a porno flick.,
174,4.0,4.0,Maria,I want to show you.,
175,4.0,4.0,Maria,I'm gonna lay down.,
176,4.0,4.0,Maria,And I want you to look at my boceta.,
177,4.0,4.0,Maria,"It's a Portuguese word for ""pussy.",
178,4.0,4.0,Carrie,""" Meanwhile, Miranda, still off sex and on chocolate couldn't bring herself to order the seven éclairs she really wanted.",
179,4.0,4.0,Carrie,So she asked for just one.,
180,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"One cake, please.",
181,4.0,4.0,Miranda,- Which do you recommend?,
182,4.0,4.0,Clerk,- I'd go with the Louvre.,
183,4.0,4.0,Clerk,Monsieur Payard's signature chocolate cake.,
184,4.0,4.0,Miranda,Sold.,
185,4.0,4.0,Clerk,"Okay, that'll be $74.50",
186,4.0,4.0,Miranda,As in 74 dollars and 50 cents? ,
187,4.0,4.0,Clerk,Yes.,
188,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Miranda decided she didn't need a cake that badly especially when she could make one for under $5.,
189,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Every once in a while, a girl has to indulge herself.",
190,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,I'm on the mallard! ,
191,4.0,4.0,Trey,Sorry.,
192,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,He still hasn't asked me to move back in.,
193,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,We make love all over the apartment.,
194,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,In the morning I get in a cab and go home like a Park Avenue hooker!,
195,4.0,4.0,Miranda, - Can't you bring it up?,
196,4.0,4.0,Charlotte," - No! We finally got the penis working, I don't want to scare it.",
197,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,Why can't I have the relationship and the sex? - Why is it one or the other? ,
198,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- You got me.,
199,4.0,4.0,Miranda,I wanna order.,
200,4.0,4.0,Samantha,Where's the lesbian du jour? ,
201,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Listen, you guys, when she gets here, we have to talk about her relationship. She was mad we didn't take it seriously last time.",
202,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,Please.,
203,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,"She isn't having a relationship, she's just doing this to bug us.",
204,4.0,4.0,Carrie,I don't know.,
205,4.0,4.0,Carrie,They haven't even had sex yet.,
206,4.0,4.0,Carrie,She said she wants it to be special.,
207,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,- Really? ,
208,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- Yeah.,
209,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,Then we should be supportive.,
210,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,This is the healthiest thing she's done in ages.,
211,4.0,4.0,Miranda,Does anybody want to split the chocolate pudding? ,
212,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"Morning, ladies.",
213,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- Morning.,
214,4.0,4.0,"Charlotte, Miranda",- Hi! ,
215,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,Tell us about your relationship.,
216,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,How is everything going with Maria? ,
217,4.0,4.0,Samantha,Did you know that when a vagina gets engorged it expands to the size of a fist? It's like a fabulous cave.,
218,4.0,4.0,Miranda,I guess they've had sex.,
219,4.0,4.0,Carrie,- Apparently so.,
220,4.0,4.0,Samantha,- And we have three holes down there.,
221,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,"Okay, stop talking about your relationship.",
222,4.0,4.0,Samantha,But it's fascinating! There are places a dick just can't go.,
223,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Some dicks manage just fine.,
224,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"Please, Maria has 10 dicks.",
225,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"For the record, you started this.",
226,4.0,4.0,Carrie,I am sorry but a finger is not a dick.,
227,4.0,4.0,Miranda,A finger is more like a third of a dick.,
228,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"So technically, Maria only has three and a third dicks.",
229,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"I can tell you right now, this is not the same as this.",
230,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,"Okay, put that away.",
231,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"I'm just saying, size has nothing to do with it.",
232,4.0,4.0,Miranda,What's happening to you? ,
233,4.0,4.0,Samantha,"I'm getting an education. Not only do I now know everything there is to know about the glorious boceta That's Portuguese for ""pussy.",
234,4.0,4.0,Carrie,""" ""Boceta, schmagina, let's call the whole thing off.",
235,4.0,4.0,Samantha,""" The most important thing is that Maria has taught me how to connect during sex.",
236,4.0,4.0,Samantha,It's not just some animal act.,
237,4.0,4.0,Samantha,It's about two people making love.,
238,4.0,4.0,Ray,Hi.,
239,4.0,4.0,Ray,I couldn't pick a shirt.,
240,4.0,4.0,Ray,"Red, blue, I didn't know.",
241,4.0,4.0,Ray,"Come on in, I'm making margaritas.",
242,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Look what I bought today.,

248,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Don't play anything.,
249,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Don't scat, don't chop, don't blend Could we Could we just sit and talk for a while? ",
250,4.0,4.0,Ray,"The ""gotta talk"" girl, gotta talk. ""What are you thinking? Where is this going?"" ",
251,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"I'm not that girl. I'm not any girl, I just want to talk.",
252,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"You know, talk.",
253,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Like, where are you from? You said something about the Jersey Shore.",
254,4.0,4.0,Ray,I spent a couple summers there.,
255,4.0,4.0,Ray,Worked on the boardwalk.,
256,4.0,4.0,Ray,There was a skeet shooting place I went to.,
257,4.0,4.0,Ray,"- On the Jersey Shore? - Upstate New York, college.",
258,4.0,4.0,Ray,"And, pull! Man, why no skeet in the city? I love the skeet.",
259,4.0,4.0,Ray,I should open one in New York.,
260,4.0,4.0,Ray,Maybe sell a club.,
261,4.0,4.0,Ray,When was the last time you had canned corn? That sounds good right now.,
262,4.0,4.0,Ray,"You hungry? No, because remember I met I had a pot pie in Vegas once, loaded with corn ",
263,4.0,4.0,Carrie,As Ray talked I realized he wasn't spontaneous and unpredictable and thrilling.,
264,4.0,4.0,Carrie,He was a guy with ADD.,
265,4.0,4.0,Carrie,What kind of relationship could I have with a guy I couldn't even talk to? ,
266,4.0,4.0,Ray,Flaky crust.,
267,4.0,4.0,Carrie,I'd have to end it.,
268,4.0,4.0,Ray,You like pies? ,
269,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Wanna play me? ,
270,4.0,4.0,Ray,Yeah.,
271,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Eventually.,
272,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, uptown",
273,4.0,4.0,Trey,I was thinking.,
274,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Charlotte gave Trey one more chance to ask her to move in.,
275,4.0,4.0,Trey,I'm just gonna say it.,
276,4.0,4.0,Trey,Next time I'm hard would you consider measuring my John Thomas? ,
277,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,What? No! ,
278,4.0,4.0,Trey,"I understand, it's juvenile, I know.",
279,4.0,4.0,Trey,But I've just never seen it like this.,
280,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,I'm taking a shower.,
281,4.0,4.0,Carrie ,Charlotte was never a woman who cared much about penises and now a penis was running her life.,
282,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Forget it.,
283,4.0,4.0,Carrie,As Charlotte lathered up she really started to get lathered up.,
284,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Who did he think he was? He was her husband, and she was his wife.",
285,4.0,4.0,Carrie,What the hell was going on in this Upper East Side nightmare? ,
286,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,I'm tired of being married to your penis! I am a person.,
287,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,"This is supposed to be a relationship! And I am done walking on eggshells! ""Don't talk about moving in in front of the penis ""'cause it might go soft.",
288,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,""" ""The penis likes this,"" and ""The penis doesn't like that!"" And ""The penis wants to be measured!"" ",
289,4.0,4.0,Trey,- It was just a thought.,
290,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,- Here's another thought! You can shove this marriage up your ass! ,
291,4.0,4.0,Trey,Don't go. ,
292,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,"I'm going home to my own apartment, where I have a lease.",
293,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,I hope that you and your penis have a very lovely night! ,
294,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Miranda was getting fed up as well with herself.",
295,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Hi, it's me, leave a message.",
296,4.0,4.0,Miranda,"I know you're probably busy having mind-blowing sex right now but I feel that you need to know, your good friend, Miranda Hobbes has just taken a piece of cake out of the garbage and eaten it.",
297,4.0,4.0,Miranda,You'll probably need this information when you check me in to the Betty Crocker Clinic.,
298,4.0,4.0,Carrie,That night Miranda realized she'd been using chocolate as a substitute for sex and now she needed a substitute for chocolate.,
299,4.0,4.0,Carrie,The strike was officially over.,
300,4.0,4.0,Maria,That's perfect! ,
301,4.0,4.0,Carie,Just when she thought she knew everything there was to know about women Samantha caused the very elusive female ejaculation.,
302,4.0,4.0,Samantha,Was that good or bad? ,
303,4.0,4.0,Maria,That was very good.,
304,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Samantha got the relationship and the sex.,
305,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"In fact, a little more sex than she'd expected.",
306,4.0,4.0,Carrie,I want some water.,
307,4.0,4.0,Ray,You want some water? Be right back.,
308,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"The next morning, I woke up with a new thought.",
309,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Maybe Ray was like jazz.,
310,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Instead of trying to make him be something else, I needed to let go and appreciate him for what he was.",
311,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Truly mind-blowing sex.,
312,4.0,4.0,Carrie,But unfortunately I got the feeling Ray had stopped playing me and moved on to another instrument.,
313,4.0,4.0,Trey,"Morning, ma'am.",
314,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,Morning.,
315,4.0,4.0,Trey,You left something at my At the apartment.,
316,4.0,4.0,Trey,I want you to move back in and get rid of this old apartment.,
317,4.0,4.0,Trey,"And stay all night, every night.",
318,4.0,4.0,Trey,And wake up next to me every morning and be my wife.,
319,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,- You do?,
320,4.0,4.0,Trey, - Yeah. I talked it over with my penis and we both agree.,
321,4.0,4.0,Trey,I don't want to lose you again.,
322,4.0,4.0,Trey,Charlotte York MacDougal will you remarry me? ,
323,4.0,4.0,Charlotte,"Yes, Trey MacDougal I will remarry you.",
324,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"Walking home from ADD, ""another dating disaster"" I worried that there's a reason they call it ""mind-blowing"" sex.",
325,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Maybe that kind of physical connection obliterates the chance of an intellectual one.,
326,4.0,4.0,Carrie,Or maybe it's possible to find both.,
327,4.0,4.0,Carrie,"That's what I was hoping, because great sex is great but I still like a song with a melody I can sing to.",

0,4.0,5.0,Carrie,New York City can be a terrifying place.,
1,4.0,5.0,Miranda,Hi.,
2,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"- Just coffee and a muffin, please.",
3,4.0,5.0,Cashier,- That'll be $7.50,
4,4.0,5.0,Cashier,Nothing's more frightening than the prospect of seeing an ex before you've had your morning coffee.,
5,4.0,5.0,Steve,Miranda?,
6,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- You made me burn my tongue.,
7,4.0,5.0,Steve,"- I got to work on that, sorry.",

10,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"Good, you know, boring.",
11,4.0,5.0,Miranda,What's new with you?,
12,4.0,5.0,Steve,I guess that means you didn't get the invitation yet.,
13,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"No, invitation to what? ",
14,4.0,5.0,Steve,I'm finally doing it.,
15,4.0,5.0,Steve,I'm opening up my own bar.,
16,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"- Steve, you're kidding! That's ",

20,4.0,5.0,Steve,I'd really love it if you'd come.,

27,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Miranda, I'm still asleep.",
28,4.0,5.0,Carrie,How can you have had an emotional mini-drama already? ,
29,4.0,5.0,Miranda,No way I'm going to his opening.,
30,4.0,5.0,Miranda,Do you think I should go? ,
31,4.0,5.0,Carrie,- Let me think for a second.,
32,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- What really pisses me off is it was my idea.,
33,4.0,5.0,Miranda,I'm the one who told him to open his own bar.,
34,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- But do I get any credit? ,
35,4.0,5.0,Carrie,- I'm guessing not.,
36,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"Of course not, it's infuriating! Why wasn't he this ambitious while with me? ",
37,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Maybe you inspired him.,
38,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Maybe he named the bar ""Miranda's"" or ""Hobbes' Nob.",
39,4.0,5.0,Miranda,""" He named the bar ""Scout.",
40,4.0,5.0,Miranda,""" After his dog.",
41,4.0,5.0,Miranda,I'm not going to that.,

43,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"You guys are friends now, right? That's what friends do.",
44,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"Really? You're my friend, does that mean you have to go? ",
45,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Of course.,
46,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Absolutely.,

50,4.0,5.0,Samantha,- What is it? ,
51,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"""Steve and Aidan""? ",
52,4.0,5.0,Carrie,How did this happen? Why are they even friends? ,
53,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"According to Steve's girlfriend, Jessica who answered his phone while he was in the shower today",
54,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"I love how you say ""Jessica,"" like allegedly that's her name.",
55,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- Aidan is Steve's silent partner.,
56,4.0,5.0,Samantha,- I wonder why I didn't get an invitation.,

58,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"Come on, it's a big party, you may not even see him.",
59,4.0,5.0,Carrie,It's not a party.,
60,4.0,5.0,Carrie,It's a parade of our failed relationships.,
61,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Next, you're gonna tell me that my junior prom date's the barback.",
62,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,It's good Aidan invited you.,
63,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,It means he's ready to be friends.,
64,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"I don't know what it means, don't want to find out.",
65,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"It means, ""I forgive you, please come.",

71,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Let's not invite Maria.,
72,4.0,5.0,Samantha,I could use a night away from the old ball and chain.,
73,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Don't tell me you're in a sapphic slump.,
74,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"All we ever do is lie around, take baths together and talk about feelings.",
75,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,I think they call that a relationship.,
76,4.0,5.0,Samantha,I don't know how you do it.,
77,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"All that emotional chow-chow, it's exhausting.",
78,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"I know, don't you just hate that? ",
79,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Women. That night, Samantha was determined to get Maria out of the tub and out on the town.",
80,4.0,5.0,Maria,"I do not see why we're out in this crowd with all this smoke, when we could be home, relaxing together.",
81,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"I thought it'd be fun to take our relationship out on dry land for a change, that's all.",
82,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"Besides, what's the fun of getting clean if you can't get a little dirty first? ",
83,4.0,5.0,Bartender,"Samantha Jones what's it gonna be tonight, darling, the usual? ",
84,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Brian here happens to make the most dangerous mojitos in the city.,

101,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"No, sweetie, I know.",
102,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"But since you don't really like to go out, I thought ",

104,4.0,5.0,Bartender,Enjoy.,
105,4.0,5.0,Bartender,I get off at 4:00.,
106,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Samantha had to face her past, and Charlotte was facing her future.",
107,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Now that Trey had no problem getting hard in the bedroom she saw no reason why their bed should be.,
108,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,Bunny.,
109,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,Hi.,
110,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,What are you doing here? ,
111,4.0,5.0,Bunny,When Trey told me you two were buying a new bed I insisted he let me help.,
112,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"I picked out the one he has now, did you know that? - It's Chippendale.",
113,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,- No.,
114,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,- Where is Trey? ,
115,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"- Still at the hospital, I expect.",
116,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"Don't fret, we'll find a mattress to fit the frame.",
117,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"You know, we were hoping to find a bed that was a little bigger and less hard.",
118,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"My dear, I'm a firm believer in firm mattresses.",
119,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"Look, the perfect dust ruffle.",
120,4.0,5.0,Bunny,Five-pleat gusseted duster with a foot drop.,
121,4.0,5.0,Bunny,I have one just like it.,
122,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"Actually, Bunny most of the newer beds don't even need dust ruffles.",
123,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"My dear child, you cannot not have a dust ruffle.",
124,4.0,5.0,Bunny,It's unsightly.,
125,4.0,5.0,Bunny,This is divine.,
126,4.0,5.0,Bunny,Nice and firm.,
127,4.0,5.0,Trey,"Hello, my darling girls.",
128,4.0,5.0,Trey,Sorry I'm late.,
129,4.0,5.0,Trey,"I see you've started without me, Mother.",
130,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"Trey, you simply must get in and feel this, it's sublime.",
131,4.0,5.0,Trey,Hello.,
132,4.0,5.0,Trey,"This is comfy, isn't it? Charlotte, you really must try this.",
133,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,- I was thinking more along the line ,
134,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"- Charlotte, for heaven's sake, get in.",
135,4.0,5.0,Trey,This is heaven.,
136,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"- I'm sorry, this is just way too ",
137,4.0,5.0,Trey,"- Firm? - All right then, something softer.",
138,4.0,5.0,Bunny,- Something with a dust ruffle.,
139,4.0,5.0,Trey,"Whatever you say, Mother.",
140,4.0,5.0,Trey,You know best.,
141,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"You hear it too, Fatty?",
142,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- I think I might have a ghost.,
143,4.0,5.0,Carrie,- I think I might have to hear that again.,
144,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"There were weird noises last night, right above me.",
145,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"The cat heard it, too.",
146,4.0,5.0,Carrie,If the cat heard it ,
147,4.0,5.0,Carrie,That's not a ghost.,
148,4.0,5.0,Carrie,That's some weird upstairs neighbor's nocturnal - what have you.,
149,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"- That's what I thought, too, at first.",
150,4.0,5.0,Miranda,But this morning the super let me in upstairs and there's no one living there.,
151,4.0,5.0,Miranda,The place is completely empty.,
152,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"And I know it sounds crazy, but last night I could feel it.",
153,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Did the cat feel it, too? ",
154,4.0,5.0,Miranda,The hairs on the back of my neck all stood up.,
155,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,My grandmother had a ghost.,
156,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,And finally she had to tell it to leave.,
157,4.0,5.0,Samantha,That's exactly what you're supposed to do.,
158,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"Confront the ghost, acknowledge its presence, then release it.",
159,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- How do you happen to know that? ,
160,4.0,5.0,Samantha,- Everybody knows that.,
161,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"The thing that I don't understand is, why now? I've been living there for two years.",
162,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"When I was living alone, I used to feel scared like that all the time.",
163,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"But now that I'm back with Trey, I feel so safe.",
164,4.0,5.0,Miranda,What are you saying? I have a ghost because I'm single? That's discrimination.,
165,4.0,5.0,Carrie,New York is definitely haunted.,
166,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Old lovers, ex-boyfriends.",
167,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Anyone you have unresolved issues with, you are bound to run into again and again until you resolve them.",
168,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"My relationship with Aidan was long dead, but with one invitation he was suddenly a presence in my life again.",
169,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Or had he been there all along? Like the chair he made that I could never bring myself to sell.,
170,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"When a relationship dies, do we ever really give up the ghost? Or are we forever haunted by the spirits of relationships past? ",
171,4.0,5.0,Maria,Why did you not introduce me to that Sean? ,
172,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"He's nobody, just a guy I used to fuck.",
173,4.0,5.0,Maria,And the bartender man? ,
174,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"He's nobody, just a guy I used to fuck.",
175,4.0,5.0,Maria,And why have you not told this nobody that you are with a somebody now?,
176,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"What am I supposed to say? ""Hi, this is my lesbian lover, and P.S.",
177,4.0,5.0,Samantha,", I'm done with dick""? ",
178,4.0,5.0,Maria,Who said anything about dick? I was talking about our relationship.,
179,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Of course you were.,
180,4.0,5.0,Maria,Do you miss a dick? Is that what this is all about? It's okay to tell me.,
181,4.0,5.0,Maria,We should talk about this.,
182,4.0,5.0,Samantha,We're talking.,
183,4.0,5.0,Maria,Okay.,
184,4.0,5.0,Maria,I'll talk.,
185,4.0,5.0,Maria,How many men have you been with?,
186,4.0,5.0,Samantha,How many women have you been with?,
187,4.0,5.0,Maria,Twelve.,
188,4.0,5.0,Maria,Have you been with more than 12 men? ,
189,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Why are we even talking about this? ,
190,4.0,5.0,Maria,Why are you so afraid to talk?,
191,4.0,5.0,Maria,- Always pulling away.,
192,4.0,5.0,Samantha,- I'm not pulling away.,
193,4.0,5.0,Samantha,I'm trying to get closer.,
194,4.0,5.0,Maria,Not like that.,
195,4.0,5.0,Maria,Not with sex.,
196,4.0,5.0,Maria,I cannot just turn it on and off.,
197,4.0,5.0,Maria,"After all, I'm not a man.",
198,4.0,5.0,Samantha,You know what? I think I'm clean now.,
199,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"That night, Charlotte found herself haunted by dust ruffles, ducks and Bunny.",
200,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"Your mother decorated this entire apartment, didn't she? ",
201,4.0,5.0,Trey,Of course.,
202,4.0,5.0,Trey,Mother does all our houses.,
203,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,I should have known.,
204,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,Plaid and the mallards.,
205,4.0,5.0,Trey,You don't like them? ,
206,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"No, it's like we live in the Museum of Natural Ugliness! If we're really serious about making a fresh start with our marriage and making this our home it should reflect our taste, shouldn't it? ",
207,4.0,5.0,Trey,"I have no taste, clearly.",
208,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"Then my taste, for us.",
209,4.0,5.0,Trey,"Darling, Mother spent an awful lot of time and money on this place.",
210,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,I understand.,
211,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,But I am your wife.,
212,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"So, maybe I should just have a chat with her.",
213,4.0,5.0,Trey,"Let me talk to her, it might go easier.",
214,4.0,5.0,Trey,"Tomorrow, when she comes over for brunch I will sit her down and say that this is simply not our, slash, your taste.",
215,4.0,5.0,Trey,The animals have got to go.,
216,4.0,5.0,Carrie,But the next morning ,
217,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"Up and at 'em, George McFaddam.",
218,4.0,5.0,Bunny,It's daylight in the swamp.,
219,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Trey was in no condition to talk to anyone.,
220,4.0,5.0,Trey,"Hello, Mother.",
221,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"Darling, what's the matter? Are you ill? Here, let Mother Sore throat.",
222,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"Charlotte, telephone my house and tell Geneva to bring over some broth and my overnight case.",
223,4.0,5.0,Bunny,You have a busy week at the gallery.,
224,4.0,5.0,Bunny,I might as well stay in the guest room until Trey's recovered.,
225,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"Charlotte, what's this mallard doing here? He lives in the study.",
226,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"Yes, Bunny.",
227,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Since I wasn't going to risk an awkward public confrontation at Aidan's opening, I wanted to at least make a gesture.",
228,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Some small way of saying, ""Thank you for inviting me.",
229,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"""For being braver than I could have been.",
230,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"""And for at least suggesting that we can be friends.",
231,4.0,5.0,Carrie,""" Hello? There was no sign of him.",
232,4.0,5.0,Carrie,But he was everywhere.,
233,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"In the mahogany bar, the wood floors the carved ceiling.",
234,4.0,5.0,Carrie,The whole place looked and felt just like Aidan.,
235,4.0,5.0,Steve,What are you doing here? ,
236,4.0,5.0,Carrie,I was just in the neighborhood. I just couldn't resist a little sneak preview.,
237,4.0,5.0,Steve,- Did Miranda come with you? ,
238,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"- No, I just I won't be able to come to the opening so, I wanted to thank Aidan, you know, for inviting me, so it's a mulberry bush.",
239,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"You know, 'cause the bar is on Mulberry Street.",
240,4.0,5.0,Steve,"Carrie, that's really sweet.",
241,4.0,5.0,Steve,"Only Aidan didn't exactly invite you, I did.",
242,4.0,5.0,Carrie,You did.,
243,4.0,5.0,Steve,"Cause I thought Miranda might feel more comfortable if she knew you were gonna be here, so ",
244,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"So, then Aidan didn't invite me? ",
245,4.0,5.0,Steve,"Not exactly, but ",
246,4.0,5.0,Aidan,Steve! ,
247,4.0,5.0,Carrie,I got to go.,
248,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"That night, I wasn't the only one who was haunted.",
249,4.0,5.0,Carrie,One phone call later ,
250,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Does the ghost like Oreos? ,
251,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"At this point, I'm almost hoping there is a ghost. Otherwise, I'm insane.",
252,4.0,5.0,Carrie,You say that like it's an either-or proposition.,
253,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"I know, I'm sorry for making you come over.",
254,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"I just needed another person here, you know? 'Cause the cat's an unreliable witness.",
255,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Don't worry.,
256,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"I checked the rarely invoked haunted-house clause of the best-friend contract, you're completely covered.",
257,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, across the park Charlotte, haunted by Bunny's decision to spend the night couldn't sleep either.",
258,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,Bunny! What are you doing?,
259,4.0,5.0,Bunny,I remembered I had some Vicks in my bag.,
260,4.0,5.0,Bunny,It's the best thing for a cold.,
261,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,But I already gave him some NyQuil.,
262,4.0,5.0,Bunny,NyQuil doesn't cure anything except consciousness.,
263,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,Don't you think I should do that? ,
264,4.0,5.0,Bunny,It's no bother.,
265,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,But I am his wife.,
266,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"If anyone does it, it should be me.",
267,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"Not on his tummy, Charlotte.",
268,4.0,5.0,Bunny,You're trying to break up the phlegm.,
269,4.0,5.0,Bunny,Let me.,
270,4.0,5.0,Bunny,You don't know what you're doing.,
271,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,And you're being very inappropriate.,
272,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"I'm sorry, but this just isn't going to work.",
273,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"Trey and I are back together, and this is our house.",
274,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,And we will redecorate it as we see fit.,
275,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,"No more plaid, no more duck decoys.",
276,4.0,5.0,Charlotte,From now on there can only be one lady of the house.,
277,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"I've been in this house far longer than you, my dear.",
278,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"And unlike you, I never left.",
279,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"Believe me, the decoys may come and go but I'm going to be here forever.",
280,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,"Samantha, you home? Come on, baby, open up, it's me, Sean.",
281,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,Sam.,
282,4.0,5.0,Samantha,What are you doing here? It's 3:00 in the morning.,
283,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,Let's fuck.,
284,4.0,5.0,Samantha,- How did you even get in? ,
285,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,- Your security code's still the same.,
286,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,"How about it, can I come in? ",
287,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"No, you can't be here right now.",
288,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,"Come on, I got hard just walking up your stairs.",
289,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,- You got another guy in here or something? ,
290,4.0,5.0,Samantha,- No.,
291,4.0,5.0,Maria,Not another guy.,
292,4.0,5.0,Maria,I'm Maria Samantha's girlfriend.,
293,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,Good for you.,
294,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,That's Maybe I could come in and you two could make me a sandwich or something.,
295,4.0,5.0,Samantha,I don't think tonight's gonna be good for us.,
296,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,"Come on, I'm only in town for just a I'm sorry.",
297,4.0,5.0,Maria,"You get away from the door, motherfucker! Before I call the cops! ",
298,4.0,5.0,Sean Sullivan ,"Okay, goodnight.",
299,4.0,5.0,Carrie,And with that Maria released Samantha's ghost and confronted Samantha.,
300,4.0,5.0,Maria,You let men come to your door like this in the middle of the night? ,
301,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"Let it go, it's all in the past.",
302,4.0,5.0,Maria,It's not in the past.,
303,4.0,5.0,Maria,It's serving us drinks.,
304,4.0,5.0,Maria,It's on the answering machine.,
305,4.0,5.0,Maria,It's at your door in the middle of the night.,
306,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"All right, this might come as a shock to you, but I used to have sex with men.",
307,4.0,5.0,Maria,This man was here for nothing but sex.,
308,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"Yes, which I used to enjoy and haven't had much of since I got into this relationship.",
309,4.0,5.0,Maria,You call this a relationship? ,
310,4.0,5.0,Samantha,It's tedious and the sex is dwindling.,
311,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"So, from what I've heard, yes.",
312,4.0,5.0,Maria,If you have something to say to me ,
313,4.0,5.0,Samantha,I have nothing to say to you.,
314,4.0,5.0,Samantha,I am fresh out of things to say to you.,
315,4.0,5.0,Samantha,All we ever do is talk.,
316,4.0,5.0,Samantha,The talking in our relationship has replaced the fucking in our fucking relationship! I don't want talk! I want passion.,
317,4.0,5.0,Samantha,I want fireworks! ,
318,4.0,5.0,Maria,Do you want fireworks? I'll show you fireworks! That's fireworks.,
319,4.0,5.0,Samantha,What are you doing? Stop it! Stop! My plates! ,
320,4.0,5.0,Maria,These are not your plates! You don't even cook! Want a little firework? Another little one? ,
321,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Didn't even leave a card.,
322,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Now he won't know what the plant's supposed to mean.,
323,4.0,5.0,Carrie,It's like I plant-bombed him.,
324,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"So, how did the bar look? ",
325,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Like Aidan.,
326,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Amazing.,
327,4.0,5.0,Miranda,Good for Steve.,
328,4.0,5.0,Carrie,- That's convincing.,
329,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- I know.,
330,4.0,5.0,Miranda,I'm trying to be happy for him.,
331,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"He's got his own bar, his own life, his own Jessica.",
332,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"And I'm still here, you know? In the same apartment, doing the same job, living the same life.",
333,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"But you have something that no one else has, you have a ghost.",
334,4.0,5.0,Miranda,You have a ghost.,
335,4.0,5.0,Miranda,You have two.,
336,4.0,5.0,Carrie,But at least Big's the friendly ghost.,
337,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Aidan, on the other hand I'm just afraid the way I treated him is gonna haunt me the rest of my life.",
338,4.0,5.0,Carrie,- There's nothing I can do about it.,
339,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- Sure there is.,
340,4.0,5.0,Miranda,Come to the party.,
341,4.0,5.0,Carrie,- Didn't invite me.,
342,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- Steve's a good guy.,
343,4.0,5.0,Miranda,He wouldn't have invited you if it wasn't okay with Aidan.,
344,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Do you ever think that you might still have feelings for Steve? ,
345,4.0,5.0,Miranda,No.,
346,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"God, no, why? Do you? For Aidan?",
347,4.0,5.0,Carrie,No.,
348,4.0,5.0,Carrie,I don't know.,
349,4.0,5.0,Carrie,I don't think so.,
350,4.0,5.0,Carrie,I don't know.,
351,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Thank you.,
352,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"I left Miranda's early, got some sleep and in the light of day it felt like all my ghosts had disappeared.",
353,4.0,5.0,Carrie,And I saw the world exactly as it was.,
354,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"A few days later, Trey felt better, too.",
355,4.0,5.0,Carrie,So did Charlotte.,
356,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Especially since Bunny moved out of the guest room and back into her own apartment.,
357,4.0,5.0,Bunny,"Up and at 'em, George I brought some Oh, dear.",
358,4.0,5.0,Bunny,I brought some muffins for breakfast.,
359,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Charlotte didn't know whether it was their making love or their making love on a bed without a dust ruffle that had offended her.,
360,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"But either way, their sexorcism ensured Bunny never haunted their home again unless expressly invited.",
361,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"While downtown, a dearly departed spirit suddenly reappeared.",
362,4.0,5.0,Maria,"It's been two days, I was worried.",
363,4.0,5.0,Maria,And you didn't even call.,
364,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Neither did you.,
365,4.0,5.0,Maria,I brought you a gift.,
366,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Better be dishes.,
367,4.0,5.0,Maria,Open it.,
368,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Maria made one last-ditch effort to give Samantha what she thought she needed.,
369,4.0,5.0,Samantha,You bought me a strap-on? ,
370,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Samantha was touched.,
371,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Since she couldn't bring herself to admit she wasn't capable of being in a relationship she simply said.,
372,4.0,5.0,Samantha, I guess we could give it a try.,
373,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"That night, despite all my fears and reservations I let Miranda and Samantha talk me into going to the opening of Scout.",
374,4.0,5.0,Miranda,Wow.,
375,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Who are all these attractive people? Hello.,
376,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Who cares? We're looking for Aidan, ladies.",
377,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Eyes akimbo.,
378,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"That's it, stealth.",
379,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"What you doing there, sister? Getting your groove on, doing the robot?",
380,4.0,5.0,Samantha,I threw my back out.,
381,4.0,5.0,Miranda,How? ,
382,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Fucking Maria with a strap-on.,
383,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"She fucked me, I fucked her.",
384,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"With all the fucking and talking, I had no idea men had to work so hard.",
385,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"How does a strap-on work, exactly? Is it belted or ",
386,4.0,5.0,Carrie,Could we not have the strap-on conversation right now? This night is hard enough as it is. - All right.,
387,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- How does it work? ,
388,4.0,5.0,Carrie,What did I just say? ,
389,4.0,5.0,Samantha,It doesn't.,
390,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Maria and I broke up.,
391,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Sweetie, I'm sorry.",
392,4.0,5.0,Miranda,Was it the strap-on that broke the relationship's back or just yours? ,
393,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Maria thinks I have intimacy issues.,
394,4.0,5.0,Samantha,She's crazy.,
395,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"I tried, I really did, but I'm not a relationship person.",
396,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"- I told her from the start, didn't I? ",
397,4.0,5.0,Carrie,- You most certainly did.,
398,4.0,5.0,Samantha,I did.,
399,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Then she has to go and fall in love with me.,
400,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"I mean, what the fuck! I need a drink.",
401,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Would it be bad to have a martini with my muscle relaxant or bad in a good way? ,
402,4.0,5.0,Miranda,I don't know.,
403,4.0,5.0,Miranda,Are you operating heavy machinery this evening? ,
404,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Never again.,
405,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Where's the bar in this bar? ,
406,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"Miranda was right. When you see a ghost, you just know it.",
407,4.0,5.0,Carrie,You can feel it.,
408,4.0,5.0,Carrie,The hairs on the back of your neck stand up.,
409,4.0,5.0,Carrie,That was it? That's all I get? ,
410,4.0,5.0,Carrie,I don't even know what that was.,
411,4.0,5.0,Miranda,I don't know who that was.,
412,4.0,5.0,Miranda,Was that Aidan? ,
413,4.0,5.0,Samantha,"Does he look better, or have I just been with a woman too long?",
414,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"All right, that's enough.",
415,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"I'm going home, I don't know why I came.",
416,4.0,5.0,Miranda,Because I begged you to.,
417,4.0,5.0,Miranda,"Come on, let me buy you ladies a free drink.",
418,4.0,5.0,Samantha,Okay.,
419,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- I'll meet you at the bar.,
420,4.0,5.0,Carrie,- Okay.,
421,4.0,5.0,Steve,You came! I'm so glad.,
422,4.0,5.0,Steve,So? ,
423,4.0,5.0,Steve,- What do you think? ,
424,4.0,5.0,Miranda,- I think - I think you did good.,
425,4.0,5.0,Steve,- Really? You mean it? 'Cause I never would've done this if it wasn't for you.,
426,4.0,5.0,Miranda,What are you saying? I didn't do anything.,
427,4.0,5.0,Steve,Are you kidding me? This whole thing was your idea.,
428,4.0,5.0,Steve,You always told me I should start my own bar.,
429,4.0,5.0,Steve,I never forgot that.,
430,4.0,5.0,Steve,"I just never thought that I could, so thanks.",
431,4.0,5.0,Miranda,You did good.,
432,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"And just like that, Miranda gave up the ghost.",
433,4.0,5.0,Steve,"Come on, let's get you drunk.",
434,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"An hour later, since my ghost hadn't reappeared I decided to sneak out the side door for some cake and a smoke.",
435,4.0,5.0,Carrie,"You're not seriously smoking that, are you? ",
436,4.0,5.0,Aidan,- Is that all you could carry?,

2,4.0,6.0,Aidan,"Hey, this is Aidan.",
3,4.0,6.0,Aidan,I'm not in.,
4,4.0,6.0,Aidan,Leave a message.,

7,4.0,6.0,Grace,"Remember, every movement has a meaning.",
8,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I wondered what it meant that I wanted to talk to my ex-boyfriend again.,
9,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I've been making faux calls to Aidan.,
10,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,- What? ,
11,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"""Faux.",
12,4.0,6.0,Carrie,""" F-A-U-X, where you dial but you have no idea what to say if he answers.",

15,4.0,6.0,Carrie,- That's pretty much it.,
16,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,- Why would you do that? ,
17,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I don't know.,
18,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I don't know why I'm telling you.,

24,4.0,6.0,Samantha,- Why are you calling him? ,
25,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I think I want him back.,

28,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I can accept that.,
29,4.0,6.0,Carrie,How do I do this? ,
30,4.0,6.0,Samantha,You don't.,

61,4.0,6.0,Samantha,- Fake nipples.,
62,4.0,6.0,Miranda,And why are we carrying them around? ,
63,4.0,6.0,Samantha,They were sent to me as a promotional thing.,
64,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Really? Is there a Nipple Council? Do nipples have a bad rap? ,
65,4.0,6.0,Samantha,Nipples are huge right now. Open any magazine.,

88,4.0,6.0,Marathon Man,"Ten-minute mile, right? I was here last week.",
89,4.0,6.0,Miranda,I know.,
90,4.0,6.0,Miranda,But the thing is we never get any cute guys in this group.,
91,4.0,6.0,Miranda,The cute guys are in the seven-minute mile group.,
92,4.0,6.0,Marathon Man,"I'm the cutest of the slow guys, is what you're saying? Knee surgery.",
93,4.0,6.0,Miranda,Have you run the marathon before? ,
94,4.0,6.0,Marathon Man,- Past four years.,
95,4.0,6.0,Miranda,- Wow.,
96,4.0,6.0,Marathon Man,- What about you? ,
97,4.0,6.0,Miranda,- First time.,
98,4.0,6.0,Marathon Man,We should train during the week.,
99,4.0,6.0,Miranda,Are there runs during the week? ,
100,4.0,6.0,Marathon Man,I don't know. I meant just the two of us.,
101,4.0,6.0,Miranda,"Sure, that'd be great.",
102,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"Miranda was thrilled, but she still wasn't sure if he was interested in anything more than a running buddy.",
103,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"And uptown, Charlotte's marathon redecoration continued.",
104,4.0,6.0,Trey,I can't believe I ever questioned this wallpaper.,
105,4.0,6.0,Trey,I love this wallpaper.,
106,4.0,6.0,Trey,And I love you.,
107,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,I guess we're done with this room.,

111,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,"It's right off our bedroom, so Well What do you want to do with this room?",
112,4.0,6.0,Trey, It could be a good room for a B A,
113,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,B-Y? ,
114,4.0,6.0,Trey,I think we already have enough bathrooms.,
115,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Trey and Charlotte were finally on the same page.,
116,4.0,6.0,Carrie,And the page had a baby on it.,
117,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Samantha went shopping, nipples blazing and picked up a '94 cabernet and an '84 Harvard MBA.",x
118,4.0,6.0,Warren Dreyfous,"Believe me, this is nothing.",
119,4.0,6.0,Warren Dreyfous,It's a blip.,
120,4.0,6.0,Warren Dreyfous,"No, we can't retract it, because that's what you said.",
121,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"Warren Dreyfous was a founder of the communications strategy firm that made the Exxon oil spill an ""incident"" rather than a ""debacle.",

130,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"A witty, yet sexy, yet sensitive note to Aidan.",
131,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"And across town, Samantha was getting some male, as well.",
132,4.0,6.0,Samantha,"As a lover, Warren was fantastic.",
133,4.0,6.0,Carrie,But as a communications strategist he made one major mistake.,
134,4.0,6.0,Warren Dreyfous,"Samantha, does your gina-wina want a little visit from my mister-mister? ",
135,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,He didn't say that.,
136,4.0,6.0,Samantha,"It's not what he said, it's how he said it, in baby talk.",
137,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Baby talk's the worst.,
138,4.0,6.0,Carrie,How can they think it's sexy?,
139,4.0,6.0,Carrie,It's like putting ketchup on prime rib.,
140,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"Stop, you're ruining it.",
141,4.0,6.0,Samantha,"I know, it's such a shame, because this guy is hot.",
142,4.0,6.0,Samantha,I finally had to sit on his face to shut him up.,
143,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,"You know, some men use baby talk to avoid intimacy.",
144,4.0,6.0,Carrie,While others simply choose not to respond to your e-mail.,
145,4.0,6.0,Samantha,- Aidan still hasn't written back? ,
146,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"- Fourteen hours, but who's counting?",
147,4.0,6.0,Charlotte," Oh, my God! Isn't this adorable?",
148,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Don't you think that maybe it's a wee bit small? ,
149,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,"Oh, you guys. Trey and I are trying to have a baby.",
150,4.0,6.0,Samantha,Why?,
151,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Don't you think that maybe you should wait awhile? - You guys just got back together.,
152,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,- I can't wait.,
153,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,I'm the oldest woman I know who doesn't have a baby.,

187,4.0,6.0,Carrie,And now I couldn't wait another minute.,
188,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Are all these improvements in communication really helping us communicate? In matters of love do actions really speak louder than words? I decided to take action.,

267,4.0,6.0,Miranda,- Neither would I.,
268,4.0,6.0,Carrie,- Me neither.,
269,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,You wouldn't? ,
270,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"That night, Charlotte performed a more traditional wifely duty.",
271,4.0,6.0,Carrie,She cooked dinner for her husband and their guests.,
272,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,"Go ahead, everyone.",
273,4.0,6.0,Tricia Watson ,This looks amazing.,
274,4.0,6.0,Trey,Trish is amazed that anyone cooks.,
275,4.0,6.0,Tricia Watson ,"Trish has three kids, which keeps her kind of busy.",
276,4.0,6.0,Martin Watson,I don't want to sit next to the lady.,
277,4.0,6.0,Tricia Watson ,"Martin, that's ""one.",
278,4.0,6.0,Trey, How many does he get? ,
279,4.0,6.0,Tricia Watson ,- Forty-five.,
280,4.0,6.0,Martin Watson,But I don't wanna.,
281,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,"We can rearrange, if you want.",
282,4.0,6.0,Tricia Watson ,"No, it's fine.",
283,4.0,6.0,Tricia Watson ,- Do you need your inhaler?,
284,4.0,6.0,Martin Watson,- No.,
285,4.0,6.0,Cliff Watson ,He's asthmatic.,
286,4.0,6.0,Cliff Watson ,Not going to be much in the sports area.,
287,4.0,6.0,Tricia Watson ,Not all little boys have to play sports.,
288,4.0,6.0,Cliff Watson ,Don't talk to me like you talk to the kids.,
289,4.0,6.0,Tricia Watson ,"Martin, up here.",
290,4.0,6.0,Trey,"- Fancy shoes there, Hank.",
291,4.0,6.0,Mary Elizabeth ,- They used to be mine.,
292,4.0,6.0,Cliff Watson ,He won't go out without 'em.,
293,4.0,6.0,Tricia Watson ,- Don't talk about him like that.,
294,4.0,6.0,Cliff Watson ,- Don't you talk to me like that.,
295,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"That night, Trey and Charlotte didn't have sex.",
296,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"And they didn't have sex the next night, either.",
297,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"This time, inaction was speaking louder than words.",
298,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"This guy from pest control comes over and sticks a few dead ones on a tape strip I, on the other hand, was full of words.",
299,4.0,6.0,Carrie,They're everywhere.,
300,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"So I say to him, ""What are they?"" He says, ""Lady, I don't know, that's why I'm sending them to the lab.",
301,4.0,6.0,Carrie,""" And I'm thinking, ""This is New York, this is the pest guy.",
302,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"""And I got something.",
303,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"He doesn't know what it is ""and that ain't good!"" ",
304,4.0,6.0,Steve,"- I gotta take a leak, I'm laughing too hard.",
305,4.0,6.0,Aidan,"- Man, I was gonna go.",
306,4.0,6.0,Steve,- And?,
307,4.0,6.0,Aidan,- And we're men.,
308,4.0,6.0,Aidan,We don't do that.,
309,4.0,6.0,Aidan,Women can do that.,
310,4.0,6.0,Aidan,Men can't.,
311,4.0,6.0,Miranda,You should go.,
312,4.0,6.0,Miranda,Break with convention.,
313,4.0,6.0,Aidan,"What the hell, I'm man enough.",
314,4.0,6.0,Steve,Do I get a say in this? We're already partners in the bar.,
315,4.0,6.0,Steve,- People are going to talk.,
316,4.0,6.0,Aidan,- We're going to the bathroom.,
317,4.0,6.0,Miranda,So apparently Aidan needed an airbag in the bathroom.,
318,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"You know, I think I'm okay.",
319,4.0,6.0,Miranda,"- You mean, you think you're over him.",
320,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"- No, I think you can go.",
321,4.0,6.0,Miranda,I don't even get flan? ,
322,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"The thing is, if you don't leave now then we're gonna have to end the night together. Hug and share cabs according to neighborhood.",
323,4.0,6.0,Carrie,And then I won't have any time alone with him.,
324,4.0,6.0,Miranda,Yeah.,
325,4.0,6.0,Miranda,Okay.,
326,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Okay.,
327,4.0,6.0,Carrie,And can you take Steve with you? ,
328,4.0,6.0,Aidan,Thank you for walking me home.,
329,4.0,6.0,Carrie,You live four blocks from the restaurant.,
330,4.0,6.0,Carrie,It's the least I could do.,
331,4.0,6.0,Aidan,Good to see you tonight.,
332,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I think I want to get back together.,
333,4.0,6.0,Aidan,"Fuck, I was afraid you were going to say something like that.",
334,4.0,6.0,Aidan,"I was willing to try the friendship thing, but I can't do the relationship thing.",
335,4.0,6.0,Carrie,You put your hand on my hand.,
336,4.0,6.0,Aidan,What?,
337,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"At the restaurant, you ",
338,4.0,6.0,Aidan,I was trying to make you comfortable.,
339,4.0,6.0,Aidan,You seemed so nervous telling that bug story.,
340,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"Oh, well then I guess I should Goodnight.",
341,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Goodnight.,
342,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"Miranda didn't answer her phone, so I left a desperate message and started to send her a desperate e-mail.",
343,4.0,6.0,Miranda,I was just about to call you.,
344,4.0,6.0,Miranda,I was IM-ing Marathon Man.,
345,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Interesting.,
346,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Will your tuchis be wanting some lingus? ,
347,4.0,6.0,Miranda,"Listen, if things work out between him and me we never had that conversation. He's coming over.",
348,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I guess you'll be having dessert after all.,
349,4.0,6.0,Miranda,What happened to my airbag outside the restaurant? Steve tried to kiss me.,
350,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Aidan kissed me.,
351,4.0,6.0,Carrie,We miskissed.,
352,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I wasn't going to kiss him.,
353,4.0,6.0,Carrie,He said he just wanted friendship.,
354,4.0,6.0,Carrie,But then he kissed me.,
355,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"What does that mean? Oh, my God, he's online.",
356,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Can he see me? ,
357,4.0,6.0,Miranda,"No, just step away from the computer.",
358,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"- No, I'm going to go back there.",
359,4.0,6.0,Miranda,- Where? Aidan's? ,
360,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I know he's home.,
361,4.0,6.0,Miranda,"Pace yourself, send him an e-mail or something.",
362,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"No, he'll just say that he doesn't want to see me, but he does.",
363,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"His words said ""no,"" but his kiss said ""yes.",
364,4.0,6.0,Miranda,""" That's the defense invoked by date rapists.",
365,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I know he still feels it.,
366,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"When men attempt bold gestures, it's generally considered romantic.",
367,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"When women do it, it's often considered desperate or psycho.",
368,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I was hoping to prove I was neither.,
369,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"Hey again, you.",
370,4.0,6.0,Aidan,- You haven't been out here since I went up? ,
371,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"- No, I went home.",
372,4.0,6.0,Aidan,And you came back?,
373,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I came back.,
374,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"See, I I think No, I feel fairly certain that there is still something between us.",
375,4.0,6.0,Aidan,"I had a nice time tonight with you, I did.",
376,4.0,6.0,Aidan,But I just want to leave it at that.,
377,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Can I come up and talk to you for a few minutes? ,
378,4.0,6.0,Aidan,I don't think that's a good idea.,
379,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Because of what might happen?,
380,4.0,6.0,Aidan,Because it's not a good time.,
381,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I know that you're probably scared.,
382,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"I would be, too.",
383,4.0,6.0,Carrie,But it's different now.,
384,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Things are different.,
385,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I'm different.,
386,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"In fact, wait a second.",
387,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"In fact, cigarettes? Gone.",
388,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"Seriously, all bad habits, gone.",
389,4.0,6.0,Carrie,This is a whole new thing.,
390,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Because I miss you.,
391,4.0,6.0,Carrie,And I've missed you.,
392,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"And it's not just because you look so good, you do, and you should know that.",
393,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"But I lie in bed at night, and I think about us.",
394,4.0,6.0,Carrie,And I think about you holding me.,
395,4.0,6.0,Aidan,You broke my heart! ,
396,4.0,6.0,Warren Dreyfous,"Samantha, I love your titty-witties.",
397,4.0,6.0,Carrie,As I was wishing I had said nothing Samantha decided she had to say something.,
398,4.0,6.0,Samantha,"You're a great fuck, but I don't need the baby talk.",
399,4.0,6.0,Samantha,"You don't have to call these my titty-witties, these are my breasts.",
400,4.0,6.0,Samantha,And you don't have to say anything about them.,
401,4.0,6.0,Samantha,"It's just sex, and it's fine.",
402,4.0,6.0,Samantha,Would you please come out of there? Can we talk about this like adults? We're not finished.,
403,4.0,6.0,Warren Dreyfous,I was very closey-wosey.,
404,4.0,6.0,Samantha,"Okay, you can call them titty-witties.",
405,4.0,6.0,Warren Dreyfous,I'm leaving.,
406,4.0,6.0,Warren Dreyfous,I got an early day tomorrow.,
407,4.0,6.0,Samantha,"Come on, don't pout.",
408,4.0,6.0,Samantha,We were having such a nice time.,
409,4.0,6.0,Samantha,It was only a suggestion.,
410,4.0,6.0,Warren Dreyfous,Where are my shoes? ,
411,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Samantha realized that she wore the nipples and attracted a big baby.,
412,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"And speaking of babies, Charlotte and Trey still were not.",
413,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,This was delivered today.,
414,4.0,6.0,Trey,I ordered that a week ago.,
415,4.0,6.0,Trey,"They needed time to engrave, and I totally forgot.",
416,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,"""We had each other and then we had you.",
417,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,"""And then we had everything.",
418,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,"""Love, Mommy and Daddy.",
419,4.0,6.0,Trey,""" It's completely premature.",
420,4.0,6.0,Trey,I was just so excited.,
421,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,And now? Do you not want a baby anymore? ,
422,4.0,6.0,Trey,Of course I do.,
423,4.0,6.0,Trey,Don't you? ,
424,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,We pretty much stopped trying after the Watsons came over.,
425,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,Kids don't even want to sit by me.,
426,4.0,6.0,Trey,I want to sit next to you.,
427,4.0,6.0,Trey,"I knew Cliff and Tricia when they were first married, they were so in love.",
428,4.0,6.0,Trey,Now they're just,
429,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,Parents.,
430,4.0,6.0,Charlotte,Maybe if we only have one child.,
431,4.0,6.0,Trey,"Have one, to start.",
432,4.0,6.0,Trey,See how we do.,
433,4.0,6.0,Trey,Besides ,
434,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Then Trey told the lie that all parents-to-be have to tell themselves in order to procreate.,
435,4.0,6.0,Trey,our kids will be different.,
436,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Even though the whole experience had them a little rattled that night Trey and Charlotte made love and possibly a baby.,
437,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"And downtown, Miranda seemingly had her communication problem licked.",
438,4.0,6.0,Carrie,And she felt like she should do something in return.,
439,4.0,6.0,Marathon Man,Would you like a massage? ,
440,4.0,6.0,Miranda,I would love one.,
441,4.0,6.0,Miranda,I don't want to do that! ,
442,4.0,6.0,Marathon Man,"Why didn't you say you weren't interested, before you were talking into my ass? ",
443,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"This time, we didn't need any words.",
444,4.0,6.0,Aidan,You want to do this to make up for the past? Relieve your conscience? ,
445,4.0,6.0,Aidan,Cause we're okay.,
446,4.0,6.0,Aidan,I've mentally kicked your butt all over Manhattan.,
447,4.0,6.0,Aidan,I'm fine now.,
448,4.0,6.0,Carrie,No.,
449,4.0,6.0,Carrie,I just I love you.,
450,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"I still love you, I just wish that I could be your girlfriend again.",
451,4.0,6.0,Aidan,I need to think about that.,
452,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"His actions said he still loved me, or maybe he just missed me or maybe he needed closure.",
453,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Maybe I'd never know.,
454,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"The next morning, due to sheer embarrassment Miranda got what she needed.",
455,4.0,6.0,Carrie,A running buddy who pushed her into the nine-minute mile group.,
456,4.0,6.0,Carrie,And I still had no response from Aidan.,
457,4.0,6.0,Aidan,"Hey, Carrie, you up there? ",
458,4.0,6.0,Aidan,"Okay, let's give it a shot.",
459,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Really? ,
460,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Do you wanna come upstairs? ,
461,4.0,6.0,Aidan,"No, I promised Pete I'd take him for a walk. You wanna go for a walk? ",
462,4.0,6.0,Carrie,Yeah! Let's go for a walk.,
463,4.0,6.0,Aidan,Okay.,
464,4.0,6.0,Carrie,"Don't move, okay? I'll be right there!",

0,4.0,7.0,Carrie,Once Aidan and I were back together it seemed like nothing had ever happened to break us apart.,
1,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"Hi, it's me, go ahead.",
2,4.0,7.0,Big,"Hey, kid.",
3,4.0,7.0,Big,What's shaking? I'm back in town.,
4,4.0,7.0,Big,"Call me, baby.",
5,4.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm ,
6,4.0,7.0,Aidan,No.,
7,4.0,7.0,Aidan,Yeah.,
8,4.0,7.0,Aidan,Yeah.,
9,4.0,7.0,Carrie,A little machine with a big message.,
10,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"- Okay, something happened.",
11,4.0,7.0,Miranda,- Something bad? ,
12,4.0,7.0,Carrie,Big called while Aidan and I were making love.,
13,4.0,7.0,Miranda,Something bad.,
14,4.0,7.0,Carrie,The machine picked up.,
15,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,- What did you do? ,
16,4.0,7.0,Carrie,- Nothing.,
17,4.0,7.0,Carrie,We just kept making love.,
18,4.0,7.0,Samantha,He could keep going after that? ,
19,4.0,7.0,Samantha,"- Honey, he's a keeper.",
20,4.0,7.0,Miranda,"- Never mind him, how'd you do?",
21,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"- Fine, I finished.",
22,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,- You did? ,
23,4.0,7.0,Carrie,I had to.,
24,4.0,7.0,Carrie,And I haven't worked that hard at anything since my SATs.,
25,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,This is awful.,
26,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,Did you talk about it? ,
27,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"No, we just went to sleep.",
28,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"And when I woke up, Aidan was on the other side of the bed.",
29,4.0,7.0,Carrie,Usually he sleeps right next to me.,
30,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"You know, like, right here and I just, I get in his little nook.",
31,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,Maybe he's just sleeping differently.,
32,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"Maybe, or maybe he'll never forget what happened and every time the phone rings he'll think that it's Big calling to start affair number two.",
33,4.0,7.0,Miranda,That's a big maybe.,
34,4.0,7.0,Carrie,I was just hoping that we could just start fresh and now we're gonna have to talk about it.,
35,4.0,7.0,Samantha,"What are you gonna do, sit Aidan down and explain about Big? ",
36,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"Unless Hallmark makes a ""Sorry I Cheated"" card.",
37,4.0,7.0,Samantha,No one wants to hear about their lover's past lovers.,
38,4.0,7.0,Samantha,"What happened was in the past, leave it there.",
39,4.0,7.0,Carrie,It's on my answering machine.,
40,4.0,7.0,Carrie,I have to talk about it.,
41,4.0,7.0,Waitress,"- Here you go, this is yours.",
42,4.0,7.0,Samantha,- Thank you.,
43,4.0,7.0,Carrie,Can I change the subject? I'll pay you a million dollars.,
44,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,I'm thinking about quitting my job.,
45,4.0,7.0,Samantha,- Did you get an offer from a better gallery? ,
46,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,"- No, I mean, stopping working.",
47,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,Altogether.,
48,4.0,7.0,Carrie,Really? ,
49,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,Yeah.,
50,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,I've been driving myself crazy lately just trying to get everything done - and Trey suggested - ,
51,4.0,7.0,Miranda,Trey suggested?,
52,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,He mentioned that maybe I might quit.,
53,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,"And I mean, really, I have just been driving myself crazy.",
54,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,And for what? The gallery? What has the gallery ever done for me? ,
55,4.0,7.0,Carrie,- But you love your job.,
56,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,- I know.,
57,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,But there's so much more I could do with my life.,
58,4.0,7.0,Miranda,Like what? ,
59,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Soon I'll be pregnant, and that'll be huge.",
60,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Plus, I'm redecorating the apartment and I always wanted to take Indian cooking classes and sometimes I'll walk by one of those Color Me Mine pottery places and I'll see a woman having just a lovely afternoon glazing a bowl.",
61,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,That'd be a nice change.,
62,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,And I wanted to volunteer at Trey's hospital.,
63,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,And help raise money for the new Pediatric AIDS wing.,
64,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"The cooking and the AIDS stuff is great, but Color Me Mine, sweetie If I was walking by and I saw you in there I'd just keep on walking.",
65,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Anyway, that's what I'm thinking.",
66,4.0,7.0,Carrie,You sure you're not just having a bad work week?,
67,4.0,7.0,Charlotte," No, that's not it. I'm quitting, that's what I want to do, yep.",
68,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,I'm quitting.,
69,4.0,7.0,Samantha,"Well, be damn sure before you get off the Ferris wheel because the women waiting to get on are 22, perky, and ruthless.",
70,4.0,7.0,Carrie,You seem to have a lot of opinions today.,
71,4.0,7.0,Samantha,I'm telling you just forget it ever happened.,
72,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"Later that day, I got to thinking about relationships and partial lobotomies.",
73,4.0,7.0,Carrie,Two seemingly different ideas that might be perfect together like chocolate and peanut butter.,
74,4.0,7.0,Carrie,Think how much easier it would all be if there was some swift surgical procedure to whisk away all the ugly memories and mistakes and leave only the fun trips and special holidays.,
75,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"But until that day arrives, what to do? Rely on the same old needlepoint philosophy of ""forgive and forget""? And even if a couple can manage the forgiveness has any ever really conquered the forgetness? Can you ever really forgive, if you can't forget? To Samantha Jones, some things were unforgivable.",
76,4.0,7.0,Carrie,And taking someone else's cab was right at the top of her list.,
77,4.0,7.0,Samantha,- I was here first! ,
78,4.0,7.0,Brad,- Sorry! ,
79,4.0,7.0,Samantha,I don't think so.,
80,4.0,7.0,Samantha,Get out! ,
81,4.0,7.0,Brad,I'm not getting out.,
82,4.0,7.0,Samantha,"West 12th and 9th Avenue, please.",
83,4.0,7.0,Samantha,I hope you enjoy the ride.,
84,4.0,7.0,Carrie,He did.,
85,4.0,7.0,Carrie,And in a far less friendly bed uptown I was even farther from the nook.,
86,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yet, I still wasn't sure, maybe I was overreacting.",
87,4.0,7.0,Carrie,You don't have to go to the gym right now.,

103,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,That's not a response.,
104,4.0,7.0,Miranda,It's an 8:15-in-the-morning response.,
105,4.0,7.0,Charlotte,The women's movement is supposed to be about choice.,

121,4.0,7.0,Miranda,- I'm hanging up.,

136,4.0,7.0,Carrie,It caused quite the stir.,
137,4.0,7.0,Carrie,"Will you help me patch up, buddy? I got a big tense meeting with my editor in about an hour.",
138,4.0,7.0,Carrie,It feels like a two-patch day.,
139,4.0,7.0,Carrie,You notice how much better I'm doing this time? ,
140,4.0,7.0,Carrie,No cheating.,
141,4.0,7.0,Carrie,I think I finally kicked that bad habit.,

398,4.0,8.0,Aidan,I know that.,
399,4.0,8.0,Carrie,Then what? ,

55,4.0,9.0,Steve,Miranda.,
56,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"Don't worry, I used a pseudonym. They gave me the name of a specialist at Beth Israel.",
57,4.0,9.0,Steve,"You don't have to do that. You don't have to do anything. I have a doctor, it's no big deal.",
58,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"Will you stop saying that? It is a big deal! This isn't your crazy yellow toenail. This is cancer. The longer you wait to find out what's going on, the longer we sit here having this conversation, the more likely it is that the cancer will spread and that you will die. It is a big fucking deal!",
59,4.0,9.0,Steve,All right.,
60,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"I made him cry. No, first, I yelled at him. I yelled at my friend, the cancer patient. Then I made him cry.",
61,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,"It's understandable. I mean, you just lost your mom. I'm sure you have a lot of pent up, residual anger.",
62,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"Maybe, but mostly he was just pissing me off.",
63,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"Sounds like he needed the good kick in the ass, which you gave him.",
64,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"You know what you need? A nice, relaxing weekend with me at Aidan's country house.",
65,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"You're not actually going, are you?",
66,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"If by ''going'' you mean being taken against my will and kidnapped, then yes, I'm going. So, enjoy me now, ladies. Because this weekend I'm a hick town hostage.",
67,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"I can't go, Steve has cancer. Somebody has to stay in town and make him feel bad about it.",
68,4.0,9.0,Carrie,You're at the Connecticut compound? Come on! It's like we're living in Paris and running off to Provence for the weekend.,
69,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"What is it about the weekends now? I swear to God, every guy I've fucked since Memorial Day wants to know what I'm doing this weekend. They just don't get it. My weekends are for meeting new guys, so I don't have to fuck the old ones.",
70,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"That's a no, I guess? I guess I'll have to brave the wilderness on my own.",
71,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,"No. Not on your own, with Aidan.",
72,4.0,9.0,Carrie,And I love Aidan. And Aidan loves the country. Maybe I'll love the country.,
73,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"Wait a minute. Just because Aidan loves the country, you have to love it, too?",
74,4.0,9.0,Carrie,Apparently that's how it works.,
75,4.0,9.0,Miranda,I see. You need to pretend to be someone else to be in a relationship.,
76,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"No, I believe the word you're looking for is ''compromise.''",
77,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,"It's true. Trey loves golf, so, I'm taking golf lessons. Trey loves Bunny, so, I'm ovulating at the orchid show.",
78,4.0,9.0,Samantha,Which hick town is it exactly?,
79,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"It's too terrible and too ironic. It's Suffern. Suffern, New York.",
80,4.0,9.0,Miranda,Sounds like you better take some Buffern to Suffern.,
81,4.0,9.0,Aidan,"Well? There's a lake right over there. One mile. This floor's all original. Dates back to 1874. The plumbing's 1974, so, of course, it needs work. But I put in a hot water heater all by myself. What do you think? Scary as you thought it'd be?",
82,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"No. God, no.",
83,4.0,9.0,Carrie,It was scarier.,
84,4.0,9.0,Aidan,- Good. Let me stick this stuff in the back. And I'll give you the grand tour.,
85,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- I'll be here.,
86,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"So, there I was... trapped in a cabin that was outdated even by CiviI War standards when I could've been out cocktailing and sample saleing.",
87,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Oh, God!",
88,4.0,9.0,Aidan,What is it? What happened? Are you ok?,
89,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"No! Oh, my God! There was a huge, giant squirrel in that window, right there.",
90,4.0,9.0,Aidan,"That's my squirrel. I've been sneaking little nuts out there. Hoping he'd come make friends, and he did.",
91,4.0,9.0,Carrie,You can't be friends with a squirrel. A squirrel is just a rat with a cuter outfit.,
92,4.0,9.0,Aidan,Is that right?,
93,4.0,9.0,Carrie,'That's my squirrel''? Any more Wild Kingdom surprises I should know about?,
94,4.0,9.0,Aidan,"Let's see, just...",
95,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Hours later, we discovered one satisfying way to pass the time in the country. Just not enough time. There I was, miles from home, hours from sleep with no one to talk to, nowhere to go, and nothing to do except.... Three hours, two mosquitoes, and one too many Vodka KooIAids later. I finally found an outlet for my computer, but not my frustration.",
96,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Relationships, no matter how good, are inevitably a series of compromises. But how much of ourselves should we be willing to sacrifice for the other person before we stop being ourselves?",
97,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"In a relationship, when does the art of compromise become compromising?",
98,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, back at the center of the civilized world...",
99,4.0,9.0,Stud,"So, what are you doing next weekend? ",
100,4.0,9.0,Stud,What did I say?,
101,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Tired of being the ''wake up and smell the coffee'' girl, Miranda invited Steve over for tea and sympathy. Or in Steve's case, Chinese food and Chop Socky.",
102,4.0,9.0,Steve,I thought you hated these movies.,
103,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"Yeah, but you don't. And the guy at Video Village said this one rocks, so... You want the last spring roll?",
104,4.0,9.0,Steve,"No, that's yours.",
105,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"No, I don't want it. You have it. Shit! They forgot the tea. Did you want tea? I can make some.",
106,4.0,9.0,Steve,"- That's it, I'm out of here. ",
107,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"- Why, where are you going?",
108,4.0,9.0,Steve,"Home. You think I wanna stay here, and be treated like some fuckin' cancer patient?",
109,4.0,9.0,Miranda,What are you talking about?,
110,4.0,9.0,Steve,Since when don't you want the last spring roll? You usually eat all these spring roll. I'm lucky if I see a spring roll.,
111,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"I'm sorry, I felt bad. In the park, you needed a shoulder to cry on. And I was a total bitch to you.",
112,4.0,9.0,Steve,"Yeah, you were. You know what, thank God, because now I have a doctor who knows what he's doing. I scheduled my operation, and I have insurance that's gonna pay for it. So, thank you for being a huge bitch. Give me that spring roll.",
113,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"The next day at the MacDougal's Connecticut compound, Bunny gave Charlotte a tour of her nursery.",
114,4.0,9.0,Bunny,"Since my boys have all grown up, my orchids have become my babies. And this year, Waxie Hanahan's Chocolate Oncidium will be no match for my Rising Suns.",
115,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,They're exquisite.,
116,4.0,9.0,Bunny,"I'm pleased you think so, Charlotte. I've repotted this one for you to take home.",
117,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,"No, I couldn't.",
118,4.0,9.0,Bunny,- But I insist. A gift in anticipation of the great gift you're giving me.,
119,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,- What gift is that?,
120,4.0,9.0,Bunny,"Why, a grandchild, my dear. You mustn't be cross with Trey for telling me. He knows how anxious I am to have a wee MacDougal to carry on the family name.",
121,4.0,9.0,Carrie,I couldn't get any sleep at all last night. The silence out here is deafening.,
122,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,You are in the country.,
123,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Then I go to take a shower and there's no water. So, now, he's working on the pipes all day, so I finally had to leave the house before I dehydrated.",
124,4.0,9.0,Cashier,- Welcome to Frozen Cup. ,
125,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- Yes, I'd like a cheeseburger, please, large fries, and a Cosmopolitan?",
126,4.0,9.0,Cashier,- What? ,
127,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- A strawberry shake, please.",
128,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,Where are you?,
129,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"I'm at the Frozen Cup in HoHoKus. I had to freaking drive to New Jersey to get cell service, and apparently, the only way to get anything to eat in the country is to make it yourself. I'm in no mood for Bisquick.",
130,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,It could be worse. Bunny's already picking out names and schools for her grandchild. I'm not even pregnant yet. She wouldn't even let the cook put shrimp in my omelet this morning.,
131,4.0,9.0,Carrie,You have a cook? How far is my country from your country?,
132,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,How is the house?,
133,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"What house? He's got squirrels running in here and there. It's Animal Farm. Four legs good, two legs bad.",
134,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,"You didn't say that to him, did you?",
135,4.0,9.0,Carrie,No. He thinks I love it. I don't even know what I'm doing out here.,
136,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,- You're keeping him company.,
137,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- I'm trying, but he's out there hoeing.",
138,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,"- So, try harder, go hoe. ",
139,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- All right.,
140,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"So, what are we gonna be doing? Are we gonna be schlepping these railroad ties over to the mudhole?",
141,4.0,9.0,Aidan,- Yes. Ma’am. ,
142,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- All righty, then.",
143,4.0,9.0,Aidan,- Don't hurt yourself. ,
144,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- I'm not gonna hurt myself.,
145,4.0,9.0,Aidan,"- All right, you ready? Here you go. ",
146,4.0,9.0,Aidan,You ok? ,
147,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- I'm fine, it's just mud.",
148,4.0,9.0,Aidan,- Ok. ,
149,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- Oh, God. Ok, go! Shit!",
150,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Ok, I'm not being helpful anymore. I think I should get back to the city. I have that meeting to get ready for. And several showers to take.",
151,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Four hours later, I kissed Aidan goodbye, kicked the mud off my boots, and had a New York steak with my New York ex.",
152,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"I tried, I really did, but nature and me... it's unnatural. And I love being with Aidan. I mean, there's no one in the world that I would rather be... I'm sorry. Is it ok to talk to you about this stuff?",
153,4.0,9.0,Big,"Go ahead, I'm ok.",
154,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Good. I'm glad that we can talk about this stuff. And listen, if you ever meet someone, I want you to feel…",
155,4.0,9.0,Big,- I met someone. ,
156,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- So, who is she?",
157,4.0,9.0,Big,"- If I tell you, you can't tell anyone. ",
158,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- Is she your imaginary girlfriend?,
159,4.0,9.0,Big,- She's an actress. Willow Summers. ,
160,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- She's not an actress, she's a movie star.",
161,4.0,9.0,Big,Did you see that Spy GirI movie? I thought she was pretty good.,
162,4.0,9.0,Carrie,I don't know about that. I do know she wears many wrong things on the red carpet. I cannot believe you are dating... someone named after a tree.,
163,4.0,9.0,Big,- She's really something. ,
164,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- How did you meet her?,
165,4.0,9.0,Big,"She came up to me at her premiere thing and asked for a light and said, ''I have two vices, smoking and green-eyed men.''",
166,4.0,9.0,Carrie,She's a smoothie.,
167,4.0,9.0,Big,"We talked, had a few... went up to her hotel... dress comes off... red panties. Kept her high heels on. I lifted her up, I put her on the bed…",
168,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Ok, that's plenty. Thanks. That was about 30 seconds. I think I did pretty good. How's the stock market treating you these days?",
169,4.0,9.0,Big,"The thing of it is, I can't get her out of my head. She's crazy about me. Willow Summers is crazy about me.",
170,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- Someone's crazy. ,
171,4.0,9.0,Big,- I'm not kidding. When I walked home from her hotel…,
172,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- You walked?,
173,4.0,9.0,Big,"- Yeah. I thought, this is something. There's something here, a connection.",
174,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- Yeah, the red panty, green-eyed connection. ",
175,4.0,9.0,Big,- Fuck. I think I'm in love.,
176,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"As I walked off my Big dinner, I realized I'd gone from pretending I didn't hate being in the country to pretending I didn't hate listening to Big's Willow talk. I may have been back in the city, but now I was really suffering. One thing was clear. I had to get back to the country. But this time, I wouldn't rely on the country to provide the entertainment. I would take the entertainment with me. Otherwise known as Samantha.",
177,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- What's next, Samantha?",
178,4.0,9.0,Samantha,- You've got to be kidding me.,
179,4.0,9.0,Carrie,Come on. We're baking a pie here.,
180,4.0,9.0,Samantha,You're baking a pie. I'm just baking. It's hotter here than it is outside. Can't we turn on the air conditioning or something?,
181,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"One cup of milk. No, we can't. There is no air conditioner. Or milk for that matter.",
182,4.0,9.0,Samantha,What time's the next train?,
183,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"No, you can't go. You have to entertain me when Aidan goes to bed in an hour.",
184,4.0,9.0,Samantha,- You lured me here under false pretenses.,
185,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- I told you that it was rustic.,
186,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"Honey, don't kid yourself. It's a dump.",
187,4.0,9.0,Carrie,Aidan worked very hard on this place. Did you know that he put that hot water heater in all by himself? With his own bare hands.,
188,4.0,9.0,Aidan,"Actually, I was wearing gloves at the time, but thanks for the shout out. Is it hot in here or is it just me?",
189,4.0,9.0,Samantha,- It isn't you. ,
190,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- I'm preheating the oven.,
191,4.0,9.0,Samantha,It couldn't be any hotter in here. Or could it? Who's the farmer with the delts?,
192,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- Young McDonald? ,
193,4.0,9.0,Samantha,- E-I-E-I-O!,
194,4.0,9.0,Aidan,"That's Luke Gilmore. Came out here from the city after the last big market crash. He doesn't say much, kinda keeps to himself.",
195,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- So, what does he do out here?",
196,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"- Pushups, by the look of him.",
197,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Oh, no. What are you up to, SammyJo?",
198,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"Honey, if we're gonna bake us a pie, we're gonna need us some milk.",
199,4.0,9.0,Samantha,- Anybody home? ,
200,4.0,9.0,Farmer Luke,- You lost?,
201,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"No. I'm staying next door, and I'm baking a pie from scratch. And I suddenly realized... fresh out of milk.",
202,4.0,9.0,Farmer Luke,- Help yourself. You from New York City? ,
203,4.0,9.0,Samantha,- Yes. But only until I can afford a little farm all my own.,
204,4.0,9.0,Farmer Luke,- Ever milk a cow before? ,
205,4.0,9.0,Samantha,- No. But something tells me I'd be very good at it.,
206,4.0,9.0,Farmer Luke,Squeeze off the milk with your thumb and forefinger. Then roll down into a fist. Squeeze and roll. ,
207,4.0,9.0,Samantha,Squeeze and roll. I think I can do that. Squeeze and roll. Squeeze... I usually get a little warning before that happens. I guess it just takes practice. Anything else around here need milking?,
208,4.0,9.0,Carrie,While Samantha worked up an appetite…,
209,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,"Trey, are you up here?",
210,4.0,9.0,Carrie,...Charlotte's eggs were ready.,
211,4.0,9.0,Trey,In the bath.,
212,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,"It's time. I'm ovulating. So, get out of the tub, get into this bed, and make love to me right now!",
213,4.0,9.0,Bunny,"Charlotte, I was just telling Trey how much you remind me of myself at your age.",
214,4.0,9.0,Trey,- There you are. ,
215,4.0,9.0,Trey,What are you doing in here? ,
216,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,- What were you doing up there?,
217,4.0,9.0,Trey,- Up where? What do you mean? ,
218,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,- What do I mean? Your mother was watching you bathe.,
219,4.0,9.0,Trey,She was not. We were having a conversation while I was in the bath.,
220,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,"I don't know how you were brought up. But that is not acceptable parent child bath time behavior past the age of 5! Even 4 in some cases. lf you think that I'm bringing a child into that, that I will be that kind of mother, then you better think again. She may have raised you like that, but I am not your mother.",
221,4.0,9.0,Trey,"I was raised by a woman named Eva Neal. She was my nanny. I don't remember ever seeing my mother ever, except after her tennis lesson and before the cocktail hour when she would draw me a bath and tell me how she'd spent her day. So, I know, I have always known that you could never ever be that kind of mother.",
222,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,- That's my ovaries. I'm ovulating. ,
223,4.0,9.0,Trey,- We'd better get to work.,
224,4.0,9.0,Charlotte,"Ok, but I have to get in the right position. Wait, stop, not like that. I have to get my legs up.",
225,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"While trying to make a baby, Charlotte and Trey accidentally destroyed Bunny's, and Waxie Hanahan's Chocolate Oncidium won first prize for the second year in a row.",
226,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Back in New York, the patient Steve was greeted by a patient Miranda.",
227,4.0,9.0,Miranda,- You're up. How are you? ,
228,4.0,9.0,Steve,- On drugs. How long you been here?,
229,4.0,9.0,Miranda,- Not long. A while. Is that ok? I...I talked to the doctor. ,
230,4.0,9.0,Steve,"- Yeah, how's he?",
231,4.0,9.0,Steve,"He said everything looked pretty good down there. I told him, frankly, I'd seen better.",
232,4.0,9.0,Nurse,Sorry. Visiting hours are over. You're going to have to leave now.,
233,4.0,9.0,Miranda,"No, I'm sorry, I don't think so.",
234,4.0,9.0,Nurse,- Are you a family member? ,
235,4.0,9.0,Miranda,- I'm his in-case-of-emergency person.,
236,4.0,9.0,Steve,"- It’s ok, Miranda, if you wanna go. ",
237,4.0,9.0,Miranda,- Shut up or I'll give you a sponge bath.,
238,4.0,9.0,Nurse,- Twenty minutes.,
239,4.0,9.0,Miranda,- Drink your juice.,
240,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, on his farm, Young McDonald had Samantha.",
241,4.0,9.0,Farmer Luke,- That was good. ,
242,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"- You're a man of few words, but they're all the right ones.",
243,4.0,9.0,Farmer Luke,What are you doing next weekend?,x
244,4.0,9.0,Carrie,Look! I made crust! Now all we have to do is put apples in and it’s pie.,
245,4.0,9.0,Aidan,Look at that.,
246,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"No, you don't understand. The only thing that I have ever successfully made in the kitchen is a mess. And several little fires. Come on, you feel like peeling some apples?",
247,4.0,9.0,Aidan,I feel like taking a shower.,
248,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Now? No! You've been outside all day, and I've been cooped up in here. Look, we'll do it together. lt'll be fun, all right? Oh, god. Damn it.",
249,4.0,9.0,Aidan,It's a squirrel! Are you ok?,
250,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"No, I am not ok! I burned my legs! And I... God! I hate that squirrel! I hate this oven! I hate this!",
251,4.0,9.0,Aidan,"House, just say it, you hate the house.",
252,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- I hate the house. ,
253,4.0,9.0,Aidan,- Thank you.,
254,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"I'm sorry, I just... I don't belong here. I don't know where anything goes and I burned my legs. It really hurts.",
255,4.0,9.0,Aidan,"Come here. Jump up here. Come on. Where is it? Oh, there it is. Is that better?",
256,4.0,9.0,Carrie,I'm sorry. I don't hate the house. I hate the squirrel.,
257,4.0,9.0,Aidan,"The squirrel's not so bad. The house, it'll get better. You'll see.",
258,4.0,9.0,Carrie,Maybe from now on I should just come on the weekends.,
259,4.0,9.0,Aidan,"- Yeah, or every other weekend. ",
260,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- I don't have to come at all.,
261,4.0,9.0,Aidan,- Ok. ,
262,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- Weekends are good.,
263,4.0,9.0,Carrie,One slow train ride and two fast-food apple pies later...,
264,4.0,9.0,Samantha,These are surprisingly delicious.,
265,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"I know. Why would anybody go to the trouble of making one when you can buy one that's so perfect, and individually sized? Wait a minute, hold still, sweetie.",
266,4.0,9.0,Samantha,- What? ,
267,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- Souvenir?,
268,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"Please, I am never leaving this city again.",
269,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"Taxi! Actually, the country's looking pretty good to me right about now.",
270,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"- Really, so you'll be back next weekend? ",
271,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"- Not next weekend, no.",
272,4.0,9.0,Samantha,"- So, when are you going back? ",
273,4.0,9.0,Carrie,- You gonna finish that pie?,
274,4.0,9.0,Carrie,"In the end, of course, Aidan and I compromised. He spent money on air conditioning. And I spent enough time in Suffern to realize that city girls are just country girls... with cuter outfits.",
0,4.0,10.0,Carrie,There are a million reasons to celebrate in New York City: Steve no longer having testicular cancer was just one of them.,
1,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- I only have one ball left. ,
2,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- I don't care who wins. It's me and you after this.,
3,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- It all comes down to just one little ball. ,
4,4.0,10.0,Steve,- Who wants a beer?,
5,4.0,10.0,Miranda,- Samantha. One ball? One ball? ,
6,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- I’m sorry. I wasn't thinking. Was he upset?,
7,4.0,10.0,Aidan,"- Embarrassed, I think. ",
8,4.0,10.0,Miranda,– There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. He's still got one.,
9,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Miranda, they come in a set like earrings.",
10,4.0,10.0,Aidan,"He’s doing great. If it were me, I'd be sitting at home depressed.",
11,4.0,10.0,Miranda,Explain that to me. Tell me why you’d be depressed if you were perfectly healthy but had to go through life without balls?,
12,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- Well. ,
13,4.0,10.0,Miranda,- I was talking to Aidan.,
14,4.0,10.0,Aidan,"Maybe it's bullshit, but I might feel less of a man or something.",
15,4.0,10.0,Miranda,A couple of hanging glands has nothing to do with making somebody a man.,
16,4.0,10.0,Samantha,She’s right. I once went out with a guy with the biggest balls I've seen. Complete pussy.,
17,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- How big? ,
18,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- Huge. I could barely fit one in my mouth.,
19,4.0,10.0,Carrie,Welcome to my world.,
20,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"The irony is I don’t think women care that much about balls. I know I don’t. Do you, Carrie?",
21,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Except for yours, darling. I'm very into yours.",
22,4.0,10.0,Samantha,"I have never met a man who wasn't into his balls. ""Oh yeah, baby, that's it. Grab my big balls. Lick them, pull them.""",
23,4.0,10.0,Miranda,- You pull the balls? ,
24,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- They like it. I went out with this guy...,
25,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- I'm sure you did. ,
26,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- Wait. Please let her finish.,
27,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"She’s done. Now, I'm thinking balls are to men what purses are to women. It’s just a little bag but we'd feel naked in public without it.",
28,4.0,10.0,Allan Jannis,- Samantha Jones.,
29,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- How are you?,
30,4.0,10.0,Allan Jannis,- Great! ,

36,4.0,10.0,Allan Jannis,Not bad. Just designed the new Richard hotel.,x
37,4.0,10.0,Samantha,I've been trying to get a meeting with him for months. Who's doing his P.R.?,
38,4.0,10.0,Allan Jannis,- I think he's talking to Brad Rosen.,
39,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- He's a hack. Get me a meeting?,
40,4.0,10.0,Allan Jannis,- I'll do what I can. ,
41,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- Good seeing you…,
42,4.0,10.0,Allan Jannis,- Allan.,
43,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- I know!,
44,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"And up on Park Avenue, a different reason for celebrating.",
45,4.0,10.0,Trey,"So, I told him, when I hire a contractor to do a job, I expect him to finish on time.",
46,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"Good, honey, good! Sometimes they just need to hear it from a man.",
47,4.0,10.0,Trey,"A little more Mu Shu, my Mu Shu.",
48,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,I saw my doctor today and I told her how frustrated we were that we weren't pregnant yet.,
49,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,Wonton?,
50,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,She said that the easiest thing to do would be to test your sperm.,
51,4.0,10.0,Trey,"Charlotte, I'm eating. Is it too much to ask to have my Mu Shu without a side of sperm?",
52,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,Why are you getting so mad? We're just talking.,
53,4.0,10.0,Trey,"Hell's bells, it's only been three months! Why would you just leap to the conclusion that the problem is me?",
54,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"I'm not leaping to anything. It’s just easier to test the man first. Less invasive. I'm sure your sperm is fine. No, it's better than fine, it's fantastic.",
55,4.0,10.0,Trey,This little subject matter has put me right off my dinner. Excuse me.,
56,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,- Trey. Honey?,
57,4.0,10.0,Trey,- Not now!,
58,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- Do men?,
59,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- Like them pulled? ,
60,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- How would I know?,

62,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- Do I what?,
63,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- Like them pulled? ,
64,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- How do I know?,
65,4.0,10.0,Carrie,Why don't we give a little tug and see?,
66,4.0,10.0,Aidan,You wanna give a little tug? You're gonna do it too hard!,
67,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- No! ,
68,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- All right.,
69,4.0,10.0,Carrie,You were saved by the bell.,
70,4.0,10.0,Aidan,"Bradshaw House of Pain, how can we hurt you? Hello?",
71,4.0,10.0,Big,"Man, it's me. I'm sorry to be calling you this late. Is Carrie there?",
72,4.0,10.0,Aidan,"- Yeah, just a sec.",
73,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- Who is it? Hello?,
74,4.0,10.0,Big,It's me. I need to talk to you.,
75,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"It’s really not a good time, we're about to go to bed.",
76,4.0,10.0,Big,"It's important. Willow is totally fucking with my head, please.",
77,4.0,10.0,Carrie,All right. He's having girlfriend problems. I'm gonna be just a minute.,
78,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Apparently, dating a movie star makes you as crazy as dating anyone else.",
79,4.0,10.0,Carrie,What's the problem?,
80,4.0,10.0,Big,"She's in town, at the Mercer. We were supposed to meet tonight. She hasn't gotten back to me.",
81,4.0,10.0,Carrie,Did you call her?,
82,4.0,10.0,Big,"Yes, I called her. I called all five of her numbers. She never answers. Here's the thing, see she can reach me, but I can't ever get her.",
83,4.0,10.0,Carrie,Maybe she never got…,
84,4.0,10.0,Big,"No, you don't get it. She can reach me but I can't get her, ever. How fucked up is that?",
85,4.0,10.0,Carrie,I don't know. Very? I thought everything was going great.,
86,4.0,10.0,Big,"It was, I mean, I flew out to LA to take her to that MTV award thing.",
87,4.0,10.0,Carrie,I'd better start feeling sorry for you soon.,
88,4.0,10.0,Big,And then she totally dissed me. I was following her around like a goddamn dog.,
89,4.0,10.0,Carrie,I'm just gonna be one more minute.,
90,4.0,10.0,Big,- Listen to this message she left me. ,
91,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- I gotta go to bed!,

95,4.0,10.0,Big,"- It’s Billy Joel, we love that song. ",
96,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,- Goodnight.,
97,4.0,10.0,Big,- Should I call her again? ,
98,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"- No, goodnight.",
99,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"I'm sorry. So, you still want me to give them a little pull?",
100,4.0,10.0,Aidan,No. Why'd you take the phone in there?,
101,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Because I know you don't like him calling here, that's all.",
102,4.0,10.0,Aidan,"You tell me nothing's going on, then nothing's going on. You don't gotta run in a closet.",
103,4.0,10.0,Carrie,I didn't run and I went in there because I know how uncomfortable it makes you.,
104,4.0,10.0,Aidan,"How uncomfortable it makes me, or you?",
105,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Me, yes, I'm uncomfortable. I don't want you to feel threatened.",
106,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- You think I'm threatened by him? ,
107,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"- No, not threatened!",
108,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- I could take him.,
109,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- Who said anything about taking him?,
110,4.0,10.0,Aidan,"I’m just saying. It’s like the time Batman and the Green Hornet got in a fight. Everyone expected Batman to win because he's got the gadgets and the cape, the shit, but the Green Hornet had the moves. See, I'm the Green Hornet, I got the moves. Plus, I got Pete and he's like Kato. Aren't you, boy? Petey, come here, boy, come here! Who's your buddy? He's gonna get him. He's got him!",
111,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,What do superheroes have to do with it?,
112,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"I have no idea. It’s a guy thing. All I know is that in order to deal with Big, he had to turn himself into the Green Lantern.",
113,4.0,10.0,Miranda,Hornet.,
114,4.0,10.0,Carrie,I don't care if he's the Green Bee. I just wish there was a way for Aidan to really understand that he has nothing to worry about. Maybe I should try to get Big and him and me together.,
115,4.0,10.0,Miranda,Did you have a big plate of crazy for lunch?,
116,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"We could all talk and Aidan could see once and for all that I love him, and Big and I are just friends.",
117,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"Carrie, I don't know.",
118,4.0,10.0,Carrie,Seriously. Keeping my relationship with Big in the closet only makes things worse.,
119,4.0,10.0,Samantha,"These are guys. They don't talk, they fight. They can't help it, it's all that crazy testosterone. God bless it.",
120,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,- We're having Trey's sperm tested. ,
121,4.0,10.0,Miranda,- Is it not doing well in school?,
122,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"We were discussing it over dinner last night and he just blew up. One minute he was perfectly happy, the next minute, furious.",
123,4.0,10.0,Samantha,That time of the month?,
124,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,It’s a side of Trey I've never seen. It’s about the sperm.,
125,4.0,10.0,Miranda,What is it with that area? It’s like a minefield.,
126,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"I spent the afternoon thinking about my friends. Body image depression, unpredictable mood swings, late night phone calls obsessing about a relationship. Did I mention these are my male friends? So, maybe men and women aren't from different planets as pop culture would have us believe. Maybe we live a lot closer to each other, perhaps, dare I even say it in the same zip code?",
127,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"In view of current circumstances, I couldn't help but wonder, are men just women with Balls?",
128,4.0,10.0,Steve,- Look at that.,
129,4.0,10.0,Miranda,- Look at what?,
130,4.0,10.0,Steve,- That dog's sack! ,
131,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"- No, Thank you.",
132,4.0,10.0,Steve,Did you know you can't enter a dog in a dog show if he's only got one Ball?,
133,4.0,10.0,Miranda,Where'd you hear that?,
134,4.0,10.0,Steve,"Around. They even make fake dog Balls. They make them for humans, too. I'm thinking about getting one.",
135,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"No, Steve. Why would you do that?",
136,4.0,10.0,Steve,Why not? Women get breast implants all the time.,
137,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"Steve, trust me, I've been to the area and I swear to God, I wouldn't know if you had one or four.",
138,4.0,10.0,Steve,"But I know. Every time I look down at my nuts, correction, nut, I look all lopsided.",
139,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"Women don't care! We care about nice arms, great eyes, big dick. I have never once heard a woman say, ''He had such a big, full scrotum!''",
140,4.0,10.0,Steve,I made an appointment. I'm talking to the doctor. Will you go with me?,
141,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"Where, testicle shopping?",
142,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Samantha finally got her meeting with hotel magnate, Richard. Smart, tough, a real ball buster.",
143,4.0,10.0,Richard,"- I've enjoyed meeting you, but truth be told, Ms. Jones, your résumé’s all fluff. ",
144,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- Fluff?,
145,4.0,10.0,Richard,It’s just parties and social events.,
146,4.0,10.0,Samantha,What is it that you do in your hotels? Nuclear fission?,
147,4.0,10.0,Richard,"I admit I'm intrigued. If I wasn't, you would've been down in the lobby having a cappuccino 10 minutes ago. Here's an idea. I'm talking to Brad Rosen. Maybe you two can get together and share the work. Five hotels, it's a big job.",
148,4.0,10.0,Samantha,"I know it's a big job. That's why I'm still here and not down in the lobby having a cappuccino. I appreciate your offer, but I don't need a partner.",
149,4.0,10.0,Richard,"Read between the lines, Ms. Jones. I deal with a lot of business… men.",
150,4.0,10.0,Samantha,What are you saying? That businessmen would be more comfortable dealing with a woman if she were working next to a man?,
151,4.0,10.0,Richard,You have a lot to offer. You might want to consider working with a partner who isn't so emotional.,
152,4.0,10.0,Samantha,"'Emotional'' is just code for, ''I don't want to hire a woman.''",
153,4.0,10.0,Richard,"Exactly. They're that way at my firm, too. Think you're gonna cry over a legal brief.",
154,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- Have you ever cried over a brief?,
155,4.0,10.0,Richard,"- Certainly, but only in the privacy of my office.",
156,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"I cried once at the gallery, once, in 10 years, and from that day on it was, ''Careful, don't make Charlotte cry.''",
157,4.0,10.0,Samantha,I have never cried at work.,
158,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"I fake cried to my editor when I missed a deadline. I told him I was having a bad time at home, but really I was having a good time in the Hamptons.",
159,4.0,10.0,Miranda,That makes the rest of us look bad.,
160,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Boo hoo, it was 80 degrees and sunny.",
161,4.0,10.0,Samantha,"A guy gets angry in a meeting, he's a pistol, a woman, she's emotional.",
162,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"If I say anything, like, ''I don't think that's hung high enough'' they say, ''Careful, don't make Charlotte cry''!",
163,4.0,10.0,Samantha,What does he think I'm going to do? Get my period and ruin his empire?,
164,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"Yes, men, wait let me rephrase that, some men…",
165,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Good move, councilor. That will look much better on the court transcripts of this dinner.",
166,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"Some men are threatened by strong businesswomen. They have to find a way to make her be just a woman again. Hence, ''You're too emotional.''",
167,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"'Hence,'' yet.",
168,4.0,10.0,Samantha,"I'm going back in there, guns blazing, cool, calm, collected. I'm going to impress that arrogant motherfucker so much he's gonna beg me to take the job.",
169,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"Just don't cry. Once, in 10 years!",
170,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"I've gotta run or I'm gonna miss my ride with Aidan. Then I'll have to take mass transit to the country, then there'll be some tears.",
171,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"The next day, while Aidan was tearing down the old shed, I was tearing through the new in Style with Big's big movie star on the cover.",
172,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- Hello? ,
173,4.0,10.0,Big,- It’s me.,
174,4.0,10.0,Carrie,What's the matter? You sound terrible.,
175,4.0,10.0,Big,Hope you don't mind my calling. I got the number off your machine. Where's area code 845?,
176,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"- Upstate, we're in the country. ",
177,4.0,10.0,Big,- On a Thursday?,
178,4.0,10.0,Carrie,We're taking a long weekend. What's wrong?,
179,4.0,10.0,Big,She broke it off. She said she never wants to see me again.,
180,4.0,10.0,Carrie,I'm so sorry.,
181,4.0,10.0,Big,"I don't even know what I did. She won't return my calls. See, she can reach me, but I can't get her.",
182,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"You mentioned that. She's crazy, I'm telling you. She has the eyes of a crazy person.",
183,4.0,10.0,Big,"Man, I was such a chump. I really put myself out there and she drop-kicked me right in the fucking heart. When are you coming back to the city?",
184,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- Monday. ,
185,4.0,10.0,Big,- Not till Monday? ,
186,4.0,10.0,Big,Fuck.,
187,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"- I'd invite you out here, but it's just so far away. ",
188,4.0,10.0,Big,- How far?,
189,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"It’s 40 minutes, you know, if there's no traffic, but with the weekenders and everything, I don't know, an hour, maybe even two.",
190,4.0,10.0,Big,- It’s Thursday afternoon. ,
191,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"- Yeah, don't you have to work?",
192,4.0,10.0,Big,"I have to see you. I'll get my Jag out of the garage. Maybe the drive will do me good. I'll come up for an hour, we’ll talk, and then I'll head home. How do I get there? Let me get a pen.",
193,4.0,10.0,Aidan,"Hey, darling. We gotta close these windows up. It gonna rain. Did I hear the phone ring? Who was it?",
194,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"It was Batman. I invited him up. I didn't mean to. I just got trapped. That crazy movie star lady broke up with him, he's devastated. He has no one else to talk to. Before I knew it I was telling him to make a right at the sign for Farm Fresh Summer Squash.",
195,4.0,10.0,Aidan,I don't want him in my house.,
196,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"I totally understand. He's gonna come up here, we're gonna have a quick talk. Then he's gonna go right back to the city where he belongs.",
197,4.0,10.0,Aidan,Fuck!,
198,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"You're my man. And I love you. He's just a friend in pain. I would never do this, but he's really hurting. Come on, haven't you ever had a girl break your…",
199,4.0,10.0,Aidan,He better be fucking upset when he gets here. There better be tears.,
200,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- Thank you. ,
201,4.0,10.0,Aidan,"- Let's go, Pete. He's got some balls coming up here.",
202,4.0,10.0,Dr. Manuel,"The prosthesis approximates the weight, shape, and feel of a normal testicle. Squeeze it.",
203,4.0,10.0,Miranda,I'm sorry. I dropped the Ball.,
204,4.0,10.0,Dr. Manuel,"Now, it comes in four sizes. Extra small, small, medium, and large.",
205,4.0,10.0,Steve,"- I'd be a… Jeez, Miranda, what would I be? ",
206,4.0,10.0,Miranda,- Medium?,
207,4.0,10.0,Steve,- Yeah? I was thinking large. ,
208,4.0,10.0,Miranda,- I'm really not an expert. Large then.,
209,4.0,10.0,Steve,- Medium. Really?,
210,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"- A large medium, Steve.",
211,4.0,10.0,Dr. Manuel,"Now, to get this model you have to enroll in a Clinical trial for market clearance.",
212,4.0,10.0,Miranda,Excuse me?,
213,4.0,10.0,Dr. Manuel,- It’s not approved yet. It’s still being tested for safety. ,
214,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"- No, Steve. No.",
215,4.0,10.0,Dr. Manuel,"- I assure you, it's perfectly safe. ",
216,4.0,10.0,Steve,- He says it's perfectly safe.,
217,4.0,10.0,Miranda,"That's what they said about the Ford Pinto. Think about it, Steve. You want a Pinto near your penis?",
218,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"And in a different urologist's office, at the exact same time.",
219,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,Hi! Is everything ok? The nurse said you wanted to see me.,
220,4.0,10.0,Trey,I'm afraid our old problem has reared its ugly head. I can't seem to rise to the occasion.,
221,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"- Let's not assume it's the same problem. Here, I bought you this. ",
222,4.0,10.0,Trey,- Juggs?,
223,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,- I know how much you like them. ,
224,4.0,10.0,Trey,- You knew I'd have a problem.,
225,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"No, I just came prepared. Look she's got big boobs. Look, so does she. It’s the Big Boob Bonanza issue!",
226,4.0,10.0,Trey,"- It’s not that, it's… ",
227,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"- What, honey?",
228,4.0,10.0,Trey,I'm afraid to. I don't think I can handle another problem in that area.,
229,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,"Don't you worry, Trey MacDougal, I'm sure that you have very strong Scottish sperm. And if you don't, we can just spin them and whip them up and do whatever it is you sexy doctor types do.",
230,4.0,10.0,Trey,- That's good. ,
231,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,- Yeah?,
232,4.0,10.0,Trey,- Keep doing that. Do that thing I like. ,
233,4.0,10.0,Charlotte,- Which thing?,
234,4.0,10.0,Trey,"You know, you give a little tug.",
235,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Turned out, Trey's Scottish sperm was fine. No, better than fine, fantastic.",
236,4.0,10.0,Trey,Where's the cup?,
237,4.0,10.0,Richard,"I have to admit, you're the best person for the job. But I'm not gonna hire you.",
238,4.0,10.0,Samantha,Give me one legitimate reason why not.,
239,4.0,10.0,Richard,Do I have to say it?,
240,4.0,10.0,Samantha,Yes. I'd like to hear the words come out of your mouth.,
241,4.0,10.0,Richard,"Ok, you slept with my architect.",
242,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Turns out, Samantha was wrong, men do talk.",
243,4.0,10.0,Richard,And I don't wanna get into all that.,
244,4.0,10.0,Samantha,Into all what? It happened 100 years ago! I barely know the guy! And how does my personal life affect your business?,
245,4.0,10.0,Richard,"I think the more accurate question would be how does your personal life affect your business? It’s too bad. Other than that, you had the job.",
246,4.0,10.0,Samantha,"You know what? If I was a guy, you would have shaken my hand, bought me a scotch and given me a key to an office. It’s amazing. A man with such innovative vision can be so shortsighted.",
247,4.0,10.0,Richard,"Ms. Jones, wait.",
248,4.0,10.0,Carrie,But Samantha couldn't wait. She could feel the tears building up inside her.,
249,4.0,10.0,Richard,- Come on! ,
250,4.0,10.0,Richard,"- Wait, not so fast!",
251,4.0,10.0,Samantha,- Close! ,
252,4.0,10.0,Richard,- Ms. Jones!,
253,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"The next day, Richard hired Samantha. He told her he admired her balls.",
254,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"When Big still hadn't arrived two hours later, I was secretly praying he'd missed the sign for Farm Fresh Summer Squash. Then, there it was, the Bat mobile.",
255,4.0,10.0,Aidan,Maybe he doesn't wanna come in and meet your dad.,
256,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- What're you doing just sitting here? ,
257,4.0,10.0,Big,- Waiting for you.,
258,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- Why didn't you come in?,
259,4.0,10.0,Big, - I don't want to go in. Let's go have a drink or something.,
260,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Wanna get a drink, where? At a Ye Old Country lemonade stand? Why are you listening to that? Come on, turn off the car and come inside. We'll talk, all right?",
261,4.0,10.0,Big,- Is he in there? ,
262,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- Yes. ,
263,4.0,10.0,Big,- I can't talk about this in front of him.,
264,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Yes, you can, and you better. So, come on, let's go. Come on. Shit.",
265,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"An hour and two bottles of red wine later, Big started talking. Unfortunately, it was mostly to himself.",
266,4.0,10.0,Big,"'Her luminous skin ''a product of vegan diet discipline.'' Vegan diet, bullshit.",
267,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"All right, give me the magazine.",
268,4.0,10.0,Big,"No, wait, listen to this one. ''I'm looking for that someone special.'' She's not looking for anybody. Bullshit. Any more wine?",
269,4.0,10.0,Aidan,Nope.,
270,4.0,10.0,Big,- ''Let's go have a drink and a smoke sometime.'' ,
271,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- You can't smoke in the house.,
272,4.0,10.0,Big,- That's cool. Guess I better head back. Thanks.,
273,4.0,10.0,Carrie," - Jesus. Look at him, he can't drive.",
274,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- What do you think you're doing? You can't drive.,
275,4.0,10.0,Big,- Call my driver.,
276,4.0,10.0,Carrie,We're an hour outside New York.,
277,4.0,10.0,Big,"I'm in a New York state of mind, seen all the movie stars.",
278,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- You're gonna have to sleep on the couch.,
279,4.0,10.0,Big,- I better not. He doesn't want me here.,
280,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- You can't drive. Sleep on the couch.,

284,4.0,10.0,Steve,"I know. I just… I was just really counting on that fake Ball. It’s just, every time I look down there, I feel…",
285,4.0,10.0,Miranda,What?,
286,4.0,10.0,Steve,"This may be hard for you to understand, but who's gonna fuck a uniball bartender?",
287,4.0,10.0,Carrie,Miranda realized the one thing she could do to help Steve didn't involve books or Balls.,
288,4.0,10.0,Big,- What's that pounding?,
289,4.0,10.0,Carrie, - Aidan's shooting hoops.,
290,4.0,10.0,Big,- Isn't it a little early? ,
291,4.0,10.0,Carrie,- You have to go out there and make friends with him.,
292,4.0,10.0,Big,"What are you talking about? We're middle-aged men, we don't make friends. We have nothing in common.",
293,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"You have me in common. If you and Aidan don't become at least a little friendly, I won't be able to stay in your life.",
294,4.0,10.0,Big,- How do I do this? ,
295,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"- You're a guy, he's a guy, there's a ball, figure it out.",
296,4.0,10.0,Big,"Hey, man. I'm sorry about last night. I guess I got a little drunk. I didn't mean to come up and ruin your weekend or anything. You play hoop? Here, why don't you give me a shot? I play a little.",
297,4.0,10.0,Big,"A little muddy, I guess all that rain.",
298,4.0,10.0,Big,"- Watch it, man. That was a little hard. ",
299,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- That wasn't that hard.,
300,4.0,10.0,Carrie,There they were. Batman and the Green Bee.,
301,4.0,10.0,Carrie,Stop it! Stop it! You're middle-aged!,
302,4.0,10.0,Big,- That dog just bit my ass! ,
303,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- Pete!,
304,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"And just like that, Kato stopped the fight.",
305,4.0,10.0,Big,"And the thing is, see she could reach me but I could never get her. Day or night, whenever she could reach me, I couldn't get her. See?",
306,4.0,10.0,Aidan,- That's fucked up. ,
307,4.0,10.0,Big,- Yeah.,
308,4.0,10.0,Carrie,"Somehow, the storm had passed and I never fully understood why. Ok, maybe men and women don't live in the same zip code, but we're moving closer.",

0,4.0,11.0,Carrie,In life sometimes we find ourselves at a crossroads. ,
1,4.0,11.0,Carrie,In New York that crossroads tends to be busy and very loud.,
2,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Sorry! You're waiting. I know I'm 10 minutes late. ,
3,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- I'm three weeks late.,
4,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- What? ,
5,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- I'm pregnant.,
6,4.0,11.0,Man,- Spare change? ,
7,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"- I'm sorry, I only have a…",
8,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- I got it. ,
9,4.0,11.0,Man,- You are beautiful ladies. You'll make some man very happy.,
10,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- You're pregnant, really? ",
11,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"- No, I just thought it might be a fun thing to say. Fuck.",
12,4.0,11.0,Carrie,You're sure?,
13,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"I took three EPT tests and I'm coming from my doctor, which is why I called you to meet me way down here on the corner of 23rd and ''I'm in Hell.''",
14,4.0,11.0,Carrie,When have you been having sex? I did not mean that the way it sounds.,
15,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- Steve. ,
16,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- You're sleeping with Steve?,
17,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"Slept. Once. Singular. It was a mercy fuck. I felt bad, he only had one Ball.",
18,4.0,11.0,Carrie,I guess that's all he needed.,
19,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"No kidding. Apparently the other one was purely ornamental. God, I'm such a fucking idiot. Why didn't I use a condom?",
20,4.0,11.0,Carrie,You didn't use a…,
21,4.0,11.0,Miranda,He only has one Ball and I have a lazy ovary! In what twisted world does that create a baby?,
22,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- I see your point. ,
23,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- It’s like the Special Olympics of conception!,
24,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Have you told him? ,
25,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- Why would I tell him? I'm not having it.,
26,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Right. ,
27,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Is it ok not to tell him? ,
28,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"- I don't know, is it?",
29,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"While Miranda took a pregnant pause, Charlotte got an unpleasant surprise of her own, her period.",
30,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Look, Charlotte brought party favors. ",
31,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- I'm never getting pregnant!,
32,4.0,11.0,Samantha,Would you please move the Tampax away from my toast points?,
33,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"When I think of all those women, every day getting pregnant, getting pregnant. ",
34,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"I've been trying for five months, nothing!",
35,4.0,11.0,Carrie,Don't worry. You'll get pregnant.,
36,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,When? A woman of 35 has only a 30 percent chance of conceiving. The numbers go down from there.,
37,4.0,11.0,Miranda,Numbers can be wrong.,
38,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"If it's so hard, how do you account for the number of crying children on planes?",
39,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,This is not a laughing matter.,
40,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"I'm sorry. I thought this was brunch, not a fertility seminar.",
41,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Ok, let's all just… ",
42,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Charlotte, should we get you a menu?",
43,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- It’s me. I probably can't have a baby. ,
44,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Don't say that.,
45,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"- It’s true. Trey checked out fine. It’s me, I know it's me. ",
46,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- It’s not you.,
47,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"Then what is it? I keep hearing all these stories about people getting pregnant just looking at each other. I do it on my head, on my side, on my back, on the top, on the bottom, on the top, then the bottom.",
48,4.0,11.0,Samantha,Now this is brunch talk.,
49,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,Do you know how many times Trey and I have done it without a condom? 73. Have you any idea how much perfectly fine semen that is?,
50,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"No. Samantha, rough estimate?",
51,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,Enough for me to know in my bones that it's me. The big joke is I spent my entire 20s worried that I'd get pregnant. I could've screwed everything in sight!,
52,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"Coulda, woulda, shoulda.",
53,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"I should've been so lucky to get pregnant by mistake. Ok. What's with the eyes, Miranda?",
54,4.0,11.0,Miranda,Nothing.,
55,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,You're just sitting there. You haven’t said a word and you're making ''the eyes.'',
56,4.0,11.0,Miranda,It’s nothing.,
57,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- You think I'm pathetic or something? ,
58,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- It’s not about you.,
59,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- What's not about me? ,
60,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- I cannot think of a worse time to tell you this.,
61,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Oh, man. ",
62,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- What the ''f'' is going on?,
63,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- I'm pregnant. Steve. ,
64,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- Mercy fuck?,
65,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"He only has one ball, it isn't fair!",
66,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Take a breath. Here, honey, have a sip of water. ",
67,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,How could you do this to me?,
68,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- To you? ,
69,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Ok, stop, please. Stop.",
70,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- What are you gonna do? ,
71,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- You're not even going to consider having it?,
72,4.0,11.0,Miranda,This is not in my plans right now and I really feel awful talking about this in front of you.,
73,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- Then I'll leave. ,
74,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- No,
75,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- You can just sit here and have your abortion talk. ,
76,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Come on, Charlotte, please sit down.",
77,4.0,11.0,Carrie,She didn't mean it. All she can think about right now is babies.,
78,4.0,11.0,Miranda,She makes me sound so…,
79,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"Don't do that. Ok, it's less than a desirable situation, but it happens. We've all been there.",
80,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- I haven't. ,
81,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"- I've had two. Carrie, how many have you had?",
82,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- One. ,
83,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"- Right, that waiter at TGI Friday's.",
84,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"TGI Friday's? Please, can we not make this worse than it was? ",
85,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"He was a waiter at The Saloon, ok? ",
86,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"And let me remind you, in 1988, The Saloon was very happening.",
87,4.0,11.0,Miranda,Apparently.,
88,4.0,11.0,Aidan,You ready yet? We're approaching the 20 minute mark. Let's go!,
89,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- What? ,
90,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Nothing.,
91,4.0,11.0,Aidan,What? Are you cuckoo now? Are you going cuckoo on me?,
92,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Ok, I want to tell you something, but if I tell you, you have to swear you're not gonna tell anyone.",
93,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- I promise. ,
94,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Here. Swear on Chanel.,
95,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- I swear. ,
96,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Ok, Miranda's pregnant and she's having an abortion. ",
97,4.0,11.0,Aidan,"- Oh, man.",
98,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"And Charlotte's devastated, because she's been trying to get pregnant. She's been having a really hard time, and it's just bad all around.",
99,4.0,11.0,Aidan,"Come here. If Miranda doesn't want the kid, can't she just give it to Charlotte?",
100,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- No. It's not like a sweater. ,
101,4.0,11.0,Aidan,"- Oh, man. Who's the guy?",
102,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"See, this is the reason that you can't tell anyone. It’s Steve. And he doesn't know.",
103,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- Come on! ,
104,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- What?,
105,4.0,11.0,Aidan,I feel like you just trapped me.,
106,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"I'm sorry, I had to tell you. It’s all I could think about. Look, I can't even pick a shoe.",
107,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- She's gonna do it without telling him. ,
108,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- What?,
109,4.0,11.0,Aidan,"- What? It’s his baby, too. ",
110,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Technically, it does not gonna be anybody's baby.",
111,4.0,11.0,Aidan,So what? It’s all her decision? It seems like the guy gets the shit end of the stick.,
112,4.0,11.0,Carrie,You know it's a tough situation. I don't know.,
113,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- You ever had one? ,
114,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- No. God no. Thank God.,
115,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"- Look at that one, isn't it adorable? ",
116,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Which one?,
117,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- The red one in the middle. I love it! ,
118,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- The Birkin bag? Really? That's not even your style.,
119,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"Honey, it's not so much the style as what carrying it means.",
120,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"It means you're out $4,000.",
121,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"Exactly. When I'm tooling around town with that bag, I'll know I've made it.",
122,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Ok, let's go, the visiting hours are over. ",
123,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"- Byebye, Birkin.",
124,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- I'm going with Miranda when she goes. ,
125,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- Good. I was alone and it was awful.,
126,4.0,11.0,Carrie,Why didn't you just ask someone to go with you?,
127,4.0,11.0,Samantha,It’s not the kind of thing you list on the dorm activities board.,
128,4.0,11.0,Carrie,I lied to Aidan about having one. I don't know. It just came out. ,
129,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"And the thing is, I think he seemed relieved, relieved that he could still think of me in a certain way. I don't know why I lied to him.",
130,4.0,11.0,Samantha,Maybe you still want him to think of you in a certain way. ,
131,4.0,11.0,Samantha,It happened. ,
132,4.0,11.0,Samantha,You made the right decision at the time.,
133,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"I know, but I never told the guy or anything.",
134,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"Look, you can't go down that road. ",
135,4.0,11.0,Samantha,Did you really want to have a child with a guy who serves burgers on roller skates?,
136,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- I could have a 13yearold child. ,
137,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- You could.,
138,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- But then I wouldn't have known you. Can you imagine it? ,
139,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- No. I can't.,
140,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- I should have told Aidan. ,
141,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"- Coulda, woulda, shoulda.",
142,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"So many roads, so many detours. So many choices, so many mistakes. ",
143,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"As we drive along this road called life, occasionally a gal will find herself a little lost. ",
144,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"When that happens, I guess she has to let go of the coulda, shoulda, woulda buckle up, and just keep going. As we speed along this endless road to the destination called ''Who We Hope To Be'', I can't help but whine, are we there yet?",
145,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"For a publicist like Samantha, the road to success was paved with stars. ",
146,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Case in point, lunch with Lucy Liu.",
147,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- I had no idea you were from New York. ,
148,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,- I'm a total New York City girl from Queens.,
149,4.0,11.0,Samantha,That's amazing. I just don't get ''Queens'' from you.,
150,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,"Look, bitch, don't start with me, 'right?",
151,4.0,11.0,Samantha,That's good.,
152,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,"Ok, here's what I need. I'm looking for someone from New York. ",
153,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,"My last P.R. guy was really hooked up, but he was a total liar. I'm a big girl, just tell me the truth. I can take it, you know?",
154,4.0,11.0,Samantha,You want the truth? ,
155,4.0,11.0,Samantha,Your last Golden Globe dress was a disaster.,
156,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,"Thank you, that's what I thought. ",
157,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,But the queens kept telling me it was fierce.,
158,4.0,11.0,Samantha,A girl from Queens should know better than to listen to queens.,
159,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,- Right? ,
160,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- Right. ,
161,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,"Another thing. I was a waitress, and twenty-five percent, very nice.",
162,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"When I'm representing you, it's class all the way.",
163,4.0,11.0,Hermes Clerk,"- It’s $4,000. ",
164,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- I know.,
165,4.0,11.0,Hermes Clerk,- And there's a waiting list. ,
166,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- I assumed.,
167,4.0,11.0,Hermes Clerk,- Five years. ,
168,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- For a bag?,
169,4.0,11.0,Hermes Clerk,It’s not a bag. It’s a Birkin.,
170,4.0,11.0,Carrie,Samantha was never one for waiting in line. So she cut right to the front.,
171,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"It’s not for me, it's for Lucy Liu. I'm her press rep and I would love for her to carry this bag to a premiere next week. It would be photographed to death. Does that make a difference?",
172,4.0,11.0,Hermes Clerk,"Let me get Francesca, our press rep, on the phone.",
173,4.0,11.0,Samantha,Would you? How very helpful.,
174,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"And over on Park Avenue Charlotte decided she couldn’t wait any longer, either.",
175,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,I'm calling to make an appointment with Dr. Peck. We're having some… I'm having some difficulty.,
176,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,I think I need some fertility testing.,
177,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"I would like to make an appointment with Dr. Genya. I need to come in for a procedure, I'm pregnant. And l need not to be.",
178,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"A couple of days later, Samantha went down a road she shouldn't.",
179,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"Hello. Francesca? Samantha Jones. Question. How the fuck long does Lucy Liu have to wait for that Birkin? If they're so hard to get, maybe you can explain why I just saw a fucking nobody in a track suit carrying the exact one we want! Lucy Liu is a big big fucking star, and she wants that bag! Is ''Hermès'' French for ''We take our good old fucking time''? Thank you so much.",
180,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Oh, my God! You scared me.",
181,4.0,11.0,Steve,Sorry. It’s not a breaking and entering. We were playing basketball and your guy needed to take a leak.,
182,4.0,11.0,Aidan,Be right out!,
183,4.0,11.0,Steve,"- So, what's new? ",
184,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Nothing. Absolutely nothing. How are things?,
185,4.0,11.0,Steve,"The bar's busting my hump, but it's pretty good. So, how's Miranda, is she ok?",
186,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- What do you mean? ,
187,4.0,11.0,Steve,"- I've been calling, she don't call me back.",
188,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- She's great. ,
189,4.0,11.0,Steve,"- Yeah? She must be pretty busy then, I guess.",
190,4.0,11.0,Aidan,"- Hey, pudding. ",
191,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Did you tell him?,
192,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- What? ,
193,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- About Miranda and the…,
194,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- No! ,
195,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Are you sure?,
196,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- Yeah. ,
197,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- He's asking about Miranda.,
198,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- He always asks about Miranda. ,
199,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- You told him, didn't you?",
200,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- No. ,
201,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Listen, it's ok, I can't keep secrets either, obviously.",
202,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- I didn't tell him anything. ,
203,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- He's looking at me funny.,
204,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- That's the way he looks at everyone. ,
205,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Are you sure?,
206,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- I didn't tell him. But I think he deserves to know. ,
207,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- What does that mean?,
208,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- I don't agree with what she's doing. ,
209,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- It doesn't have anything to do with you.,
210,4.0,11.0,Aidan,"Chief, you told me. I'd just as soon not know any of it.",
211,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Listen, sometimes you get in situations that are hard. You wish not be having this conversation with him in the next room. So just go. Go, because he's probably listening.",
212,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- What's bugging you? ,
213,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Nothing.,
214,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- Let's go! ,
215,4.0,11.0,Steve,- Tell Miranda I said hi. ,
216,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Ok.,
217,4.0,11.0,Miranda,I'm on a wait list. My regular doctor doesn't do them. ''No judgment.'' That's the way she said it. Like it was all one word. ''I don't perform them no judgment.'' ,
218,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"So, I'm waiting to see if this other doctor can fit me in. I want to get it over with as soon as possible.",
219,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Have you thought any more about telling Steve? ,
220,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"- No, why would I tell Steve?",
221,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- I don't know, maybe he has a right to know. No judgment. ",
222,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- Sounds like judgment.,
223,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- I told Aidan. ,
224,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- Carrie!,
225,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- I had to. ,
226,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- He's gonna tell Steve!,
227,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- He will not, I made him swear on Chanel. ",
228,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- As long as he took the oath of fabric.,
229,4.0,11.0,Aidan,He seemed to have pretty strong opinions about the guy having a right to know.,
230,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"You know, I didn't think this could get any worse, but it has. Now I have to think about what I'm doing to Steve?",
231,4.0,11.0,Carrie,Wouldn't you want to know?,
232,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"No. I don't even want to know, and it's me. Did you tell the guy from TGI Friday's?",
233,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Jesus, it was The Saloon. And no, I didn't. It was completely different. ",
234,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"I was 22, we barely knew each other. We slept together once. After a drunken night at The Tunnel.",
235,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- The Tunnel? No judgment. ,
236,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- I was thinking maybe I should have told him.,
237,4.0,11.0,Miranda,There's no way I'm telling Steve. He'd want me to have it. You know what? ,
238,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"You're right. Forget my life, I'm having Steve's baby. Pizza for everybody!",
239,4.0,11.0,Dr. Peck,"- Everything looks just fine. Looks good. Nope. Sorry, spoke too soon. ",
240,4.0,11.0,Trey,- What is it?,
241,4.0,11.0,Dr. Peck,- Your blood and mucus tests show extremely elevated antisperm antibodies. ,
242,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- Is that bad?,
243,4.0,11.0,Dr. Peck,It just means it's gonna be that much more difficult for you to conceive naturally.,
244,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,How much more difficult?,
245,4.0,11.0,Dr. Peck,I'd give it a 15 percent shot. I would not suggest you wait much longer before you explore in vitro.,
246,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"After they learned about their detour on the road to baby, Trey had to go back to the Hospital and Charlotte decided to walk home.",
247,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- Charlotte! ,
248,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- Hi!,
249,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- ''Hi''? Are you kidding me? ,
250,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- What do you mean?,
251,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"You saw me, turned, and walked the other way.",
252,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"I didn't see you, I just changed direction. I'm allowed to change direction.",
253,4.0,11.0,Miranda,First you don't return my calls. Then you pretend not to see me on the street?,
254,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,I just… I really can't see you right now.,
255,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"You have to see me, because I'm standing right here. I'm sorry about this whole thing, but it's not a personal attack on you. It was a mistake.",
256,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,I really don't want to talk about this.,
257,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"This is hard for me, too, you know? It doesn't make it any easier, worrying that you hate me because you think you can't get pregnant.",
258,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- I can't get pregnant. ,
259,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"- If I can, you can.",
260,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,I can't! I just came from the doctor. Here. My body is attacking Trey's sperm! 15% chance. 15% chance of ever having a baby! Is it ok if I go now?,
261,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- Sure. You want me to walk with you? ,
262,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"- No. I just want to be alone, ok?",
263,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"Ok. But I'll walk a little way behind you, in case you change your mind and want to talk.",
264,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"No, I'm ok.",
265,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Charlotte walked all the way home. And even though she never turned back, she knew Miranda was behind her.",
266,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,- Hi! Sorry I'm late. ,
267,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- Don't worry about it.,
268,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,"Look what I got! Some nice man dropped it off at my hotel this morning. Hermès, It’s a…",
269,4.0,11.0,Samantha,Birkin.,
270,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,"It’s not really my style, but it's a free bag!",
271,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- It’s not exactly free. I paid for it. That's my bag. ,
272,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,- What do you mean?,
273,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"There was a five year waiting list, blah, blah, blah, I used your name.",
274,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,"- Blah, blah, blah? ",
275,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"- Cutting to the chase, yes.",
276,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,"As long as we're cutting to the chase, the P.R. rep from Hermès called and told me my rep yelled ''fuck'' at her at least 12 times. Is that your idea of class?",
277,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- That is absurd. I have never used the ''f'' word. ,
278,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,- Who the fuck are you kidding?,
279,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"Yes, I called to check on the bag. You know what? I was on my cell. Maybe she picked up some crazy person. One time I got this scary woman screaming from somewhere in New Jersey.",
280,4.0,11.0,Lucy Liu,The only thing worse than a liar is a bad liar. I won't be needing your services anymore.,
281,4.0,11.0,Samantha,I am telling you the truth.,
282,4.0,11.0,Samantha,"If I was as bad an actress as you, I'd still be serving onion rings at TGI Friday's.",
283,4.0,11.0,Samantha,That's my fucking Birkin!,
284,4.0,11.0,Carrie,And there went Lucy Liu. ALL 'cause of a lucy lie.,
285,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, I found myself back at a familiar crossroads, the corner of Columbus and 1988. It was amazing. It hadn't changed at all. Same table, same menu. Same waiter.",
286,4.0,11.0,Chad,"Burger, medium well. Calamari.",
287,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"I couldn’t believe it. His roller skates were gone and his Tony Danza Taxi hair was thinner, but it was definitely Chad. ''Drunken night at Tunnel'' Chad.",
288,4.0,11.0,Chad,- You ready to order? ,
289,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Hello there.,
290,4.0,11.0,Chad,Our soups of the day are lentil and tortilla. Did anyone get your drink order?,
291,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Chad? ,
292,4.0,11.0,Chad,- Yeah?,
293,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"It’s me, Carrie. Bradshaw. We met, like, 13 years ago. I came in a few times, half lemonade, half iced tea? And then there was that night at The Tunnel.",
294,4.0,11.0,Chad,- Tunnel? I never went to Tunnel. ,
295,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- You went to Tunnel.,
296,4.0,11.0,Chad,"- Sherry, I'm sorry, I don't remember. ",
297,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- It’s Carrie.,
298,4.0,11.0,Chad,"- Right, Carrie. ",
299,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- I'll take the lentil soup, I guess, and some crackers.",
300,4.0,11.0,Chad,Crackers come with. Was I at least smart enough to try something?,
301,4.0,11.0,Carrie,No. You were the perfect gentleman.,
302,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"I stayed in 1988 just long enough to realize I had made the right decision. Even though I was sitting in the same seat, I was in a totally different place.",
303,4.0,11.0,Carrie,Do you suffer from headaches? ,
304,4.0,11.0,Carrie,Allergies? Diabetes?,
305,4.0,11.0,Miranda,No. ,
306,4.0,11.0,Miranda,Bad judgment with old boyfriends? ,
307,4.0,11.0,Miranda,Yes.,
308,4.0,11.0,Carrie,I think I can write that in.,
309,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- Does it hurt? ,
310,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Not really. Mostly it's just unpleasant.,
311,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- What about after? How long until I feel back to normal? ,
312,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- You're gonna have to ask them.,
313,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- How long until you felt back to normal? ,
314,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Any day now.,
315,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- I'm doing the right thing. Right? ,
316,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Miranda, I cannot answer that.",
317,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- What do you think? ,
318,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- What do you think?,
319,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"- I think, what do you think? ",
320,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- You wanna go one more round?,
321,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"Charlotte only has a 15 percent chance, and she's really trying. What if I wake up at 43 and find that my one semi decent ovary gave up and I can't have kids.",
322,4.0,11.0,Carrie,43?,
323,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- That's my ''scary age.'' ,
324,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Mine's 45.,
325,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"This happened against all the odds. My stupid egg found its way to the three sperm he had left. God, is this my baby? I mean, what am I waiting for?",
326,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Sweetie, do you want to leave?",
327,4.0,11.0,Miranda,No. I can't have a baby. I could barely find the time to schedule this abortion.,
328,4.0,11.0,Nurse,- Miranda Hobbes? ,
329,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- Motherfucker.,
330,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- Take it easy. Sip slowly. ,
331,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- I'm ok.,
332,4.0,11.0,Samantha,- A little pillow here. ,
333,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- I got it.,
334,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- Hi. ,
335,4.0,11.0,Miranda,- Hi.,
336,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"Hi. I thought some flowers might do whatever it is, flowers are supposed to do in a situation like this.",
337,4.0,11.0,Carrie,I felt the same way about Entenmann's lemon strudel.,
338,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,- How are you feeling? ,
339,4.0,11.0,Miranda,"- Pretty freaked out. Charlotte, I didn't do it. I'm keeping the baby.",
340,4.0,11.0,Charlotte,"Oh, my God. We're having a baby?",
341,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"And with those four little words, three aunts were born.",
342,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"As for me, I shoulda left Miranda's earlier so I woulda been on time.",
343,4.0,11.0,Carrie,Ten minutes late. That's the charm of me.,
344,4.0,11.0,Aidan,I'm starved. They wouldn't seat me till my party was here.,
345,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- I'm your party? ,
346,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- Excuse me. Here she is.,
347,4.0,11.0,Hostess,We let the table go. It’ll be a bit of a wait.,
348,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- We can go someplace else. ,
349,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- And wait there? We'll be at the bar.,
350,4.0,11.0,Hostess,"Fine, I'll put your name on the list of the bar.",
351,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Wait. There's a wait to wait? ,
352,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- We'll be outside. Don't forget us.,
353,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Excuse me. Sorry. ,
354,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- How's that beer?,
355,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- That's classy. And no waiting. ,
356,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- Nice.,
357,4.0,11.0,Carrie,I lied to you. I did have an abortion. The condom broke. ,
358,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"Ok, that's another lie. There was no condom.",
359,4.0,11.0,Aidan,What's with all the lying?,
360,4.0,11.0,Carrie,I'm afraid you're gonna judge me. For being 18 and sleeping with a guy without a condom and getting pregnant and never telling him. ,
361,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"There, that's the whole truth. Except that I was 22. I should've known better.",
362,4.0,11.0,Aidan,Is your name really Carrie?,
363,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Yes. So are you judging me? ,
364,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- I was no angel.,
365,4.0,11.0,Carrie,- Why? Did you ever get a girl pregnant? ,
366,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- No. Not that I know of.,
367,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"- Goddamn, it must be nice to be a guy sometimes. So, am I still your girl? ",
368,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- Yeah.,
369,4.0,11.0,Hostess,- Your table is ready. ,
370,4.0,11.0,Aidan,- Be right there.,
371,4.0,11.0,Carrie,And another thing. Miranda's keeping the baby. Don't tell Steve. It’s not our business.,
372,4.0,11.0,Carrie,"They say life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. But sometimes in New York, life is what happens when you're waiting for a table.",
0,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"New York welcomes and shelters the tired, the poor, the persecuted who have been forced to leave their homes at the whim of a ruling class. Therefore, it's ironic that all Manhattanites face the same horrible uncertainty, knowing that any day they may have to utter the tragic words.",
1,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- My building's going co-op. ,
2,4.0,12.0,Aidan,- Did you get the tomatoes?,
3,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"My building's going co-op. I have to move, this is a nightmare.",
4,4.0,12.0,Aidan,Why don't you just buy the place?,
5,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- Yeah, ok, sure. That's a great idea. ",
6,4.0,12.0,Aidan,- Why not?,
7,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Aidan, I just charged tomatoes. I really don't think I'm in a position to buy an apartment.",
8,4.0,12.0,Aidan,I am.,
9,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- You are? ,
10,4.0,12.0,Aidan,- Yeah.,
11,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"I had no idea. You have a girlfriend, moneybags?",
12,4.0,12.0,Aidan,"Afraid so, and she's sexy and I like it.",
13,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Figures. ,
14,4.0,12.0,Aidan,- Seriously. You wanna talk about this?,
15,4.0,12.0,Carrie,You're not buying my apartment for me.,
16,4.0,12.0,Aidan,"Not for you, for us. I could sell my place and buy this place and that place next door. ",
17,4.0,12.0,Aidan,We could tear down that wall. We could live together.,
18,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- So then are you .Would that make you my landlord or my roommate? ,
19,4.0,12.0,Aidan,- Little of both.,
20,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- What would the rent be like? ,
21,4.0,12.0,Aidan,- Like this?,
22,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Does that include utilities? ,
23,4.0,12.0,Aidan,- No. Think about it.,
24,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"I have to admit, I was tempted by his offer. We were spending almost every night together already and we were in love and moving is such a pain in the ass. And so were the hormone injections Charlotte was facing nightly.",
25,4.0,12.0,Trey,"I don't approve of this, Charlotte. ",
26,4.0,12.0,Trey,You've got more hormones in you than a teenage boy.,
27,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- This is what we have to do now. ,
28,4.0,12.0,Trey,- We ought to try to have a baby the old-fashioned way.,
29,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- Why don't we sit around and wait for a stork? ,
30,4.0,12.0,Trey,- The doctor said there's still a chance.,
31,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"- A very, very slim chance. ",
32,4.0,12.0,Trey,- That's good news.,
33,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"If you had a patient who had a very slim chance of living, would that be good news? ",
34,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"Would you tell the family, ''Buck up, he's got a shot in hell''?",
35,4.0,12.0,Trey,Point taken.,
36,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,That's why we have to move on to in vitro. ,
37,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,It took Peggy Woodruff seven years to conceive.,
38,4.0,12.0,Trey,Who's Peggy Woodruff?,
39,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"A woman I met in the elevator. A lot of couples have trouble conceiving, and they get through it.",
40,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"In our building, there are six couples who have been through in vitro.",
41,4.0,12.0,Trey,"What did you do? Put up a flyer in the lobby ''We're barren, how about you?''",
42,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,We're not barren. We're reproductively challenged.,
43,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,And Peggy invited us over on Friday night to hear all about their experiences. Isn't that nice?,
44,4.0,12.0,Trey,As tempting as that sounds we have the Scottish Society Highland Fling Friday night.,
45,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,Do we have to fling?,
46,4.0,12.0,Trey,"Yes, it's a family tradition. First comes spring, then comes fling. We go every year.",
47,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"Ok, but when are we gonna talk to the Woodruffs?",
48,4.0,12.0,Trey,"I don't wanna talk to the Woodruffs. I'm a doctor. I'm familiar with in vitro. It’s a very invasive procedure. The success rate is extremely low, and it can take years.",
49,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"I know, honey, so, just in case, I put us on the list for a Mandarin baby.",
50,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"As Charlotte's plan for parenthood progressed with or without Trey, I began to wonder if Aidan's plan was progressing without me. He never officially moved in, but his stuff was everywhere.",
51,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- You're getting engaged! ,
52,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- I threw up. I saw the ring and I threw up. That's not normal.,
53,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- That's my reaction to marriage. ,
54,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- What do you think you'll do if he asks?,
55,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- I don't know. ,
56,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- Just say yes!,
57,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- It hasn't been long enough. Has it? ,
58,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- Trey and I got engaged after only a month.,
59,4.0,12.0,Samantha,How long before you separated?,
60,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"We're together now, and that's what matters. ",
61,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"When it's right, you just know.",
62,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- Carrie doesn't know. ,
63,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- Carrie threw up.,
64,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"So, it might not be right.",
65,4.0,12.0,Carrie,Maybe this is all happening because my building is going co-op. ,
66,4.0,12.0,Carrie,Is this a real estate merger? Am I a real estate bride?,
67,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"If there were unlimited apartments in Manhattan, we'd all be single forever.",
68,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- What did the ring look like? ,
69,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- That's the other thing. The ring was not good.,
70,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- What do you mean? ,
71,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- It was a pear shaped diamond with a gold band.,
72,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- No wonder you threw up. ,
73,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- It’s just not me.,
74,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- You wear gold jewelry. ,
75,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- Yeah, like ghetto gold, for fun. But this is my engagement ring.",
76,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- I helped pick the ring. ,
77,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- You knew about this?,
78,4.0,12.0,Miranda,Aidan wanted a female perspective. ,
79,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"P.S., I was a pregnant woman shopping for a ring with a man who's not the baby's father. ",
80,4.0,12.0,Miranda,It’s not exactly my dream scenario.,
81,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,At least you're pregnant!,
82,4.0,12.0,Miranda,Will you yell at me every time I mention it? ,
83,4.0,12.0,Miranda,Because we've got another seven months to go.,
84,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"I'll just say ''I'm not ready to get engaged yet, but I love you and I wanna live with you.'' ",
85,4.0,12.0,Carrie,How does that sound?,
86,4.0,12.0,Samantha,Like a ''no.'',
87,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"It’s a ''yes'' to living together. That's a big deal, a first for me. Don't I get some credit for that?",
88,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,Try to be nice because down the road you might wanna marry him.,
89,4.0,12.0,Carrie,I'm gonna have to act surprised. I wonder when it's gonna happen. You know when He'll do it?,
90,4.0,12.0,Miranda,No. You're on your own. I am no longer involved.,
91,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Now you're not involved. Now that I'm stuck with the bad ring. See, that's a nice ring. He should have known that ring wasn't me. How can I marry a guy who doesn't know which ring is me?",
92,4.0,12.0,Samantha,"Exactly, honey. Wrong ring, wrong guy.",
93,4.0,12.0,Carrie,Is it true what Charlotte said? Does anybody really know when it's right? And how do you know? Are there signs? Fireworks? Is it right when it feels comfortable or is comfortable a sign that there aren't any fireworks? Is hesitation a sign that it's not right or is it just a sign that you're not ready?,
94,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"In matters of love, how do you know when it's right?",
95,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Downtown, Samantha was meeting with Mr. Wright, Mr. Richard, that is. The hotel magnate slash megaclient who was fast becoming the pain in her ass.",
96,4.0,12.0,Richard,You're 7 minutes late.,
97,4.0,12.0,Samantha,It took me 15 minutes to get through your labyrinth of a lobby.,
98,4.0,12.0,Richard,Where's my London hotel? Bobby De Niro spends the weekend at Blakes and I get knocked off the page. That little fucker has stayed at my place! We gave him the fucking penthouse suite!,
99,4.0,12.0,Richard,"Now, did you ask somebody what happened or did you just spend the morning accessorizing?",
100,4.0,12.0,Samantha,I talked to the travel editor. I pulled two of our ads. It won't happen again. I also got a full-page feature on the Barcelona property out of it.,
101,4.0,12.0,Richard,Not bad.,
102,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- May I sit down now? ,
103,4.0,12.0,Richard,"- What the hell? What's with you, female trouble?",
104,4.0,12.0,Samantha,"- Let's just talk business, shall we? ",
105,4.0,12.0,Richard,"- Come on, you can tell me, I'm human.",
106,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- All evidence to the contrary. ,
107,4.0,12.0,Richard,- I love that you're not scared of me.,
108,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- My best friend might be getting engaged. ,
109,4.0,12.0,Richard,- She didn't ask you to be a bridesmaid?,
110,4.0,12.0,Samantha,"It's just, why does everyone have to get married and have kids? It’s so cliché.",
111,4.0,12.0,Richard,"You're preaching to the converted. I like to sleep around, whisk somebody off to Rio if the mood strikes me. It’s the perfect nine hour flight. Dinner on the jet, wake up in Brazil and spend the weekend in my little five star hotel. Who needs a wife when you have a life?",
112,4.0,12.0,Samantha,That's all I'm saying.,
113,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Miranda had been waiting for the right place and the right way to tell Steve about the baby.",
114,4.0,12.0,Steve,- You want sprinkles? ,
115,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"- Steve, I'm pregnant.",
116,4.0,12.0,Carrie,Instead she settled for right now.,
117,4.0,12.0,Steve,- You're what? ,
118,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- I'm pregnant. And it's yours.,
119,4.0,12.0,Vendor,That'll be $6.,
120,4.0,12.0,Steve,- You sure? ,
121,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- I've only had one shot in the last few months and it was you.,
122,4.0,12.0,Steve,- I'm the only guy you've had sex with? ,
123,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- It’s been a slow summer.,
124,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"Ok, we're done here.",
125,4.0,12.0,Steve,"- I guess it's good to know that my one Ball is still working. So, what now? ",
126,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- I'm gonna have it.,
127,4.0,12.0,Steve,"No way! When we were together, I wanted to have a baby, you said you weren't ready.",
128,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"I'm still not ready, but when am I ever gonna be ready?",
129,4.0,12.0,Steve,"Man, I just went into so much debt opening my bar. I'm thinking maybe I should sell it.",
130,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"No. You don't have to do anything. I'll take care of the baby and support it and you can visit whenever you want, but it's not gonna be your problem. It’s my decision, and it's just something I want to do for me.",
131,4.0,12.0,Steve,- Then why did you wanna talk to me about it? ,
132,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- I just thought you should know.,
133,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Later that week, I decided to head Aidan off at the pass by taking him out to dinner and accepting his proposal.",
134,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"So, yes. I say yes to living together. I think that we're ready for that step. We still have to work out the money 'cause I don't want a free ride. We're still individuals. But We'll be sharing a life and an apartment. Yes, Aidan I would love to live with you.",
135,4.0,12.0,Aidan,That makes me really happy because there's something else I wanna ask you.,
136,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Would you Excuse me for a minute? ,
137,4.0,12.0,Aidan,"- Sure, are you ok?",
138,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"I'm just gonna go to the bathroom… God, what are you doing?",
139,4.0,12.0,Female Voice,- Are you talking to me? ,
140,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- No. No, I wasn't. I'm sorry.",
141,4.0,12.0,Aidan,- Did you want dessert? ,
142,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- No. I would say no to desserts.,
143,4.0,12.0,Aidan,"All right, then. Listen, Carrie. I know that you wanted to pay, but let me get this because your rent's about to skyrocket. Give me a little something. Yeah.",
144,4.0,12.0,Trey,You're learning Chinese?,
145,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,Just in case. I wanna be able to speak to the baby.,
146,4.0,12.0,Trey,Wouldn't we teach the baby to speak?,
147,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"Sometimes you get a slightly older child. And anyhow, we ought to really try to understand her heritage.",
148,4.0,12.0,Trey,"So, it's a Mandarin girl now, is it?",
149,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"It's mostly little unwanted girls. But the good news is, since we're both dark-haired, people won't immediately know that she's not ours. I hope you remembered to pick up your kilt at the drycleaner.",
150,4.0,12.0,Trey,You know I really don't feel like going to the fling tonight.,
151,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"We have to go, it's a family tradition. We are not gonna behave like your typical barren couple!",
152,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"We can't let this get us down! We have to live! Plus, I had a plaid dress made.",
153,4.0,12.0,Trey,Maybe we should look at cutting back on your fertility drugs. Just a thought.,
154,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Taxi! What, come on, buddy, you've got nobody in there.",
155,4.0,12.0,Big,- Lady! Need a ride? ,
156,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Is this the city's solution to the cab shortage?,
157,4.0,12.0,Big,- Just a happy coincidence. ,
158,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- Admit it, you drive around looking for me, don't you?",
159,4.0,12.0,Big,"- Don't flatter yourself, you're on my turf. ",
160,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- You've got the good shops.,
161,4.0,12.0,Big,"Get in, we're holding up traffic. Going home?",
162,4.0,12.0,Carrie,Yeah. Are you seriously giving me a ride? Is it on your way?,
163,4.0,12.0,Big,"- Nope. Raoul, East 73rd Street. ",
164,4.0,12.0,Raoul,- Right away. ,
165,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Thank you.,
166,4.0,12.0,Big,"Raoul and I do this all day. Picking the ladies up, dropping them off. How've you been?",
167,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- Good, you? ",
168,4.0,12.0,Big,- Very good.,
169,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- Then I've been very, very good. ",
170,4.0,12.0,Big,- It’s not a contest.,
171,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- All right, then I take back one ''very.'' ",
172,4.0,12.0,Big,- How are things with country Bob?,
173,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- You know his name now. ,
174,4.0,12.0,Big,- Aidan.,
175,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- Things are very good there, too. ",
176,4.0,12.0,Big,- What was that?,
177,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- What? ,
178,4.0,12.0,Big,- That smile?,
179,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- I don't think you want to know. ,
180,4.0,12.0,Big,- I bet I can handle it.,
181,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Are you sure? ,
182,4.0,12.0,Big,- What the hell?,
183,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- I think he wants to marry me. ,
184,4.0,12.0,Big,"- You think, or you know?",
185,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- I know, actually. ",
186,4.0,12.0,Big,- And you've discussed it?,
187,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- No, l… it's just the kind of thing you know. ",
188,4.0,12.0,Big,- Not gonna happen.,
189,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Let's not talk about it. ,
190,4.0,12.0,Big,- He's not the guy for you.,
191,4.0,12.0,Carrie,He might be the guy for me. I'm just not ready yet.,
192,4.0,12.0,Big,"You're never gonna be ready, baby. You're not the marrying kind.",
193,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- And you, I guess, are? So, what does that tell us? ",
194,4.0,12.0,Big,- Nobody knows shit?,
195,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- Yeah. In any case, I'm not taking relationship advice, from you. ",
196,4.0,12.0,Big,- I just offered you a ride.,
197,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- Hello? ,
198,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Spy girl. Did you tell Aidan I didn't like the ring? Did you tell him not to propose?,
199,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- I'm out of this now. ,
200,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Did he change his mind? Why hasn't he asked me yet?,
201,4.0,12.0,Miranda,You're not saying yes. What's your hurry?,
202,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"I just think it's weird, he has the ring. What if he realized I'm not the one?",
203,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- You're not sure he's the one. ,
204,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- But he doesn't know that, unless you told him.",
205,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- Hang on a second. ,
206,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- What happened, did someone propose to you?",
207,4.0,12.0,Miranda,I don't know why they call it morning sickness when it's all fucking day long. Unless it's MOURN as in ''mourning'' the loss of your single life.,
208,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Apparently, we've reached the stage where our lives are making us sick. Man.",
209,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- I'm sore from the shots! ,
210,4.0,12.0,Trey,- Sorry.,
211,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"The New York Scottish Society's Annual Highland Fling. Any Scot who was anyone was there, including, of course, Bunny MacDougal.",
212,4.0,12.0,Bunny,I was wondering when you'd be arriving. You missed dinner and the dancers.,
213,4.0,12.0,Trey,"- Shoot! Sorry, Mother, my fault. Long day at work. How are you? ",
214,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"- Hello, Bunny.",
215,4.0,12.0,Bunny,"Hello, my dear, don't you look festive! Trey, you must join your brothers. They're out there making complete fools of themselves.",
216,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- Do you know that dance? ,
217,4.0,12.0,Trey,"- Unfortunately, I do. Excuse me.",
218,4.0,12.0,Bunny,"It’s the Highland fling, dear. It’s what this event was named after.",
219,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"For something called a fling, it looks like a lot of work.",
220,4.0,12.0,Bunny,That's what I used to tell Trey about you. Come. They say this dance was originally danced on the shield of a clansman. Do you know anything about clans?,
221,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,I know this is the MacDougal clan's tartan.,
222,4.0,12.0,Bunny,"Yes. MacDougal is one of the oldest Highland clans in existence. We have a very proud lineage, one I hope you and Trey will be able to perpetuate. Now, I know some things can't be helped, but I must tell you right now I don't enjoy Mandarin food and I don't enjoy a Mandarin child.",
223,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,I don't think that's any of your business.,
224,4.0,12.0,Bunny,"But it is my business. The MacDougal name will be carried on by sons of your own, not daughters of the South Pacific. Would you care for some shortbread?",
225,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"No. If we want a Mandarin baby, we can have a Mandarin baby. Nobody else needs to be involved!",
226,4.0,12.0,Bunny,"Then let's not involve the entire Scottish population of New York City, shall we?",
227,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"I'm serious. I'm doing all the work! I'm getting the hormone shots, I’m taking the pills, I'm doing the research, I'm in the chat room with the other reproductively challenged women and I'm learning Mandarin. All you have to do is jerk off into a plastic cup!",
228,4.0,12.0,Trey,"Charlotte, get a hold of yourself.",
229,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,You get a hold of yourself! And try to keep your mother out of it!,
230,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Samantha's professional relationship really started to take off.",
231,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- I would have taken it off. ,
232,4.0,12.0,Richard,- I'll buy you a new one.,
233,4.0,12.0,Dwight,"Excuse me. We're about to take off, we need you to buckle your seat belts.",
234,4.0,12.0,Richard,"- Thanks, Dwight. ",
235,4.0,12.0,Samantha,"- Sure, Dwight. Is this a good idea? You are my boss.",
236,4.0,12.0,Richard,"- Yes, and I definitely need you to see my property in Brazil. ",
237,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- This is on the clock then?,
238,4.0,12.0,Richard,"No, but, out of curiosity, what do you charge for this sort of thing?",
239,4.0,12.0,Samantha,Believe me. You couldn't afford it.,
240,4.0,12.0,Richard,- I'm a very rich man. ,
241,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- I'm a very talented woman.,
242,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,I need you to give me my shot.,
243,4.0,12.0,Trey,"For the love of God, do we have to do that tonight?",
244,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,We have to do it every night if we want to continue the MacDougal clan.,
245,4.0,12.0,Trey,I said I was sorry. What else do you expect from me?,
246,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,I don't understand why you talked to Bunny. Why don't you talk to me?,
247,4.0,12.0,Trey,Because I don't know how to tell you I'm exhausted. How much work is a marriage supposed to be?,
248,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,This is just a tough phase. Once we have a baby…,
249,4.0,12.0,Trey,- That could take years. I'm 43. When does it get easy? ,
250,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- This is what a relationship is.,
251,4.0,12.0,Trey,"No. No, this is what our relationship is. I didn’t see anyone else getting screamed at on the dance floor.",
252,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"I'm sorry, it's the hormones.",
253,4.0,12.0,Trey,- Then stop taking the hormones. ,
254,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- I can't.,
255,4.0,12.0,Trey,"I can't keep doing what we're doing. I love you, but I don't know if I'm cut out for this.",
256,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,What are you saying?,
257,4.0,12.0,Trey,"I don't think I wanna have a baby anymore. I don't have the energy. I work hard, and I like to play golf. I just want to be for a while.",
258,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,"So, you don't even want to try?",
259,4.0,12.0,Trey,"I don't. I don't wanna try. If it's the right thing, then it'll happen. If it's not, then it won't.",
260,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,But we've been planning all along to have a family.,
261,4.0,12.0,Trey,"You and I will have to be enough. I mean, I think I could be happy with just the two of us. I'm not sure you can, though.",
262,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,I'm gonna get some juice.,
263,4.0,12.0,Trey,"- Charlotte, are you all right? ",
264,4.0,12.0,Charlotte,- I don't know.,
265,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Sometimes, the question is, how do you know when it's not right?",
266,4.0,12.0,Aidan,"- See, isn't this nice? ",
267,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- It was nice being in the bed.,
268,4.0,12.0,Aidan,"- When Pete has to go, Pete has to go. ",
269,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- Ok, but why do I have to go?",
270,4.0,12.0,Aidan,Keep your old man company. Make sure some hottie doesn't come along with a little pooch and steal him away.,
271,4.0,12.0,Carrie,Pete would never leave me. Pete loves me so.,
272,4.0,12.0,Aidan,"He does, don't you, Pete? Come here. Pete loves you. Don't you love her? I love her, too. Do you have a baggie? I didn't bring a baggie.",
273,4.0,12.0,Carrie,This just gets better and better.,
274,4.0,12.0,Aidan,"Here, hold this, would you? Go ahead, open it.",
275,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"My God, it's not… God. That's such a beautiful ring.",
276,4.0,12.0,Aidan,- Really? ,
277,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Yeah.,
278,4.0,12.0,Aidan,"I had a different one, then I changed my mind. This one seemed more like you. I love you, Carrie. There's no one I could love more. I wanna live my life with you. What do you think?",
279,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Maybe there are no right moments, right guys, right answers. Maybe you just have to say what's in your heart.",
280,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Yes. ,
281,4.0,12.0,Aidan,- Gimme. Ok.,
282,4.0,12.0,Carrie,That night I surprised myself.,
283,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- Who is it? ,
284,4.0,12.0,Steve,- It’s me!,
285,4.0,12.0,Carrie,And Miranda was getting a surprise as well.,
286,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"- What, are you fucking crazy? ",
287,4.0,12.0,Steve,- That's your answer?,
288,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- Why are you proposing? ,
289,4.0,12.0,Steve,- I thought that's what you wanted.,
290,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"- I don't want to marry you, Steve. ",
291,4.0,12.0,Steve,- I don't want to marry you either.,
292,4.0,12.0,Miranda,Then what are we doing?,
293,4.0,12.0,Steve,There's gonna be a baby. And I just… I don't wanna just be a guy who sees you at the playground. I wanna help.,
294,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"That doesn't mean we have to get married. You're not in love with me, right?",
295,4.0,12.0,Steve,"No, especially not right now.",
296,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"You need to say that every day, because when you see me with this baby, you're gonna think we belong together, you’re gonna think you're in love with me.",
297,4.0,12.0,Steve,"I don't know, I've seen you with my dog, and mostly you just seem uncomfortable. How are we gonna do this? Raise a kid together and not be together?",
298,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- We'll figure it out. ,
299,4.0,12.0,Steve,- We'll figure it out.,
300,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"Miranda knew Steve wasn't right for her, but she wanted to do what was right for her baby.",
301,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"By the way, I know that's a hand-me-down ring. I would never say yes to a hand-me-down ring.",
302,4.0,12.0,Steve,- You picked out this ring! ,
303,4.0,12.0,Miranda,- For Carrie!,
304,4.0,12.0,Steve,"- Fine, frankly, I can't afford a stupid ring and a baby. ",
305,4.0,12.0,Miranda,"- See, this is working out already.",
306,4.0,12.0,Carrie,There was one person I needed to tell that surprisingly I was the marrying kind.,
307,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- Thank God you're here. ,
308,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- I have something to tell you.,
309,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- Aidan left you? ,
310,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- I'm engaged.,
311,4.0,12.0,Samantha,"Fuck you. Let's have a drink and celebrate. Two Rubies, please.",
312,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- He switched the ring on me. ,
313,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- The bastard.,
314,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- And look, it's a really good ring. ",
315,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- I've seen it.,
316,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- What? ,
317,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- Somebody had to help the poor guy.,
318,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"So, now you want me to get married?",
319,4.0,12.0,Samantha,"No, but if you're gonna ruin our lives, I'd at least like to look at a nice piece of jewelry.",
320,4.0,12.0,Carrie,- Thank you. ,
321,4.0,12.0,Bartender,- Two Rubies.,
322,4.0,12.0,Carrie,"- Are you tan, lady? ",
323,4.0,12.0,Samantha,- I was in Rio with Richard.,
324,4.0,12.0,Carrie,Rio with the CEO? A mistake.,
0,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Someone once said that two halves make a whole. And when two halves move in together, it makes a whole lot of stuff.",
1,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"- Hey, what's… ",
2,4.0,13.0,Aidan,"- Pop tart, where you been and what have you been doing?",
3,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"I got coffee and papers, but I think the more pressing question is, what have you been doing?",
4,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- Made myself an area. ,
5,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"- Yes, I can see that.",
6,4.0,13.0,Aidan,"I needed a space for my work papers and stuff, you know, so is that okay?",
7,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Yeah, sure yes, it's just… you're blocking the bathroom door.",
8,4.0,13.0,Aidan,"Yeah, but you got another one. Who needs two bathroom doors?",
9,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"I do, me. Me, the one who loves her two bathroom doors.",
10,4.0,13.0,Aidan,Why do you need two doors for?,
11,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Sometimes I'm in a hurry and it's just quicker to go, ping, out that one and it's my escape route in case.",
12,4.0,13.0,Aidan,In case what?,
13,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"In case rapists come in my bedroom window I see them in the mirror and then, phew, I'm gone.",
14,4.0,13.0,Aidan,There's a whole lot of phewing going on in that bathroom. It’s just gonna be like this until we're able to take over the apartment next door then we can load the stuff in.,
15,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"And would that be happening in the next five minutes please, God?",
16,4.0,13.0,Aidan,Closing at the end of next week.,
17,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Hello, Petey. Really, what's the problem, right? It’s just boxes, right?",
18,4.0,13.0,Carrie,A plant! The man brought a living thing into my apartment. I don't do plants. I kill everything I bring in there.,
19,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"You said yes to moving in, he moved in.",
20,4.0,13.0,Carrie,But he's taking over whole areas.,
21,4.0,13.0,Samantha,"This is why I've never lived with a man. This, and the fact that I want them out an hour after I climax.",
22,4.0,13.0,Miranda,You let them stay a whole hour?,
23,4.0,13.0,Samantha,You'd be surprised how many are ready to go again after a quick catnap.,
24,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"And there's no walls, there's nowhere to hide. As soon as I walk in, he's all up with: ''Who'd you see? Where'd you go? Who'd ya meet? What'd ya know?'' What I know is, I need time to decompress. Just be alone.",
25,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,But there have to be some adjustments. Relationships are hard.,
26,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"You guys, I miss walking into my apartment with no one there and it's all quiet and I can do that stuff you do when you're totally alone, things you would never want your boyfriend to see you do.",
27,4.0,13.0,Samantha,Like masturbate?,
28,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"My S.S.B., my Secret Single Behavior. Like, I like to make a stack of saltines. I put grape jelly on them. I eat them standing up in the kitchen reading fashion magazines.",
29,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,- Why standing up? ,
30,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"- It’s weird, but it just feels great.",
31,4.0,13.0,Miranda,I like to put Vaseline on my hands and put them in Borghese conditioning gloves while watching infomercials.,
32,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,Before I was married I used to study my pores in a magnifying mirror for an hour each night. But I'm afraid Trey will think it's weird.,
33,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"He would. You can't do that stuff in front of men. What about you, Lolita? Anything you do you wouldn't want a man to see?",
34,4.0,13.0,Samantha,- No. ,
35,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"- You know, I believe her.",
36,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Hey, didn't we make a rule about those things at lunch?",
37,4.0,13.0,Samantha,"It’s my boss, I have to take it.",
38,4.0,13.0,Samantha,"Samantha Jones. Richard, it's Sunday. Fine. I'll see you in an hour.",
39,4.0,13.0,Samantha,He wants me to drop something off this afternoon.,
40,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Nice. A little skyrockets in flight, afternoon Delight?",
41,4.0,13.0,Samantha,"- No, it's just work. ",
42,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,"- Hardly, you're sleeping with him. ",
43,4.0,13.0,Samantha,- You told them?,
44,4.0,13.0,Carrie,I also like to gossip on the phone while secretly pumicing my calluses.,
45,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"So, how is he? And spare no detail, I'm a horny pregnant person.",
46,4.0,13.0,Samantha,- I don't want to talk about it. ,
47,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- Samantha likes a guy. ,
48,4.0,13.0,Samantha,- I do not.,
49,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,You do! You do! Or you would tell us all the dirty details.,
50,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"My God, we're gonna have to ice skate home. Hell just froze over.",
51,4.0,13.0,Samantha,"Okay, you want details? He's got the most perfect dick I've ever seen. Long, pink, amazing. it's dickalicious.",
52,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"All right, so, what should I do about Aidan's stuff?",
53,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,I'm gonna have the girls over for dinner.,
54,4.0,13.0,Trey,That sounds like fun. What night?,
55,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,Just the girls. I'm trying to get my day planner back together. I have much more free time since we left the baby track.,
56,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Some apartments are cluttered with physical stuff, others, emotional stuff.",
57,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,It’s a big readjustment. I've wanted a baby ever since I was a little girl. We have a baby room and no baby.,
58,4.0,13.0,Trey,"I've got some good news. Bram Pomander thinks he's snagged us orchestra seats to The Producers next week. Charlotte, yes, we're disappointed. But life goes on. We still have to find a way to have a giggle. Come on, give me a smile.",
59,4.0,13.0,Richard,"Hold on. Investors in Munich. How do you say ""fuck you"" in German?",
60,4.0,13.0,Richard,Impressive. Why do you speak German?,
61,4.0,13.0,Samantha,"A gal has her reasons. That wasn't ""fuck you"", it was ""fuck me"".",
62,4.0,13.0,Richard,- That's a negotiation ploy I haven't tried before. ,
63,4.0,13.0,Samantha,- Who’re you kidding?,
64,4.0,13.0,Richard,- Where's the magazine layout? ,
65,4.0,13.0,Samantha,"- Signed, sealed, delivered.",
66,4.0,13.0,Richard,One more thing.,
67,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"It was perfect: long, pink, amazing.",
68,4.0,13.0,Richard,I thought about you all weekend.,
69,4.0,13.0,Samantha,Let me see if I can give you something to think about all evening. Bring out that gorgeous dick.,
70,4.0,13.0,Richard,You're gonna get down on your knees right here? What if my assistant sees you?,
71,4.0,13.0,Samantha,I dropped my portfolio. That may take some time to pick up.,
72,4.0,13.0,Samantha,Das ist einen sch?nen perfekten Schwanz.,
73,4.0,13.0,Richard,"Whoops. Better get those, while you're down there.",
74,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"If I had known you were gonna turn out to be so not a loser, I would have run home after work and changed.",
75,4.0,13.0,Walker,Or at least put on some fresh deodorant. Careful. I was a much younger man when we started trying to set up this blind date.,
76,4.0,13.0,Miranda,You're the one who kept canceling to go to… Where were you?,
77,4.0,13.0,Walker,"First time, Spain and Romethe, second time, Luxembourg and Athens.",
78,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Walker Lewis, fluent in five Languages, traveled the world as a State Department interpreter.",
79,4.0,13.0,Walker,"Seriously, Miranda, best blind date I have ever had in the continental U.S.A.",
80,4.0,13.0,Walker,"What? Listen, any reason I can't see you again before I go to Brussels?",
81,4.0,13.0,Miranda,He is so cute and funny and sexy. And I really want to have sex with him. But I don't know. Is it okay to fuck one guy when you're pregnant with another guy's baby?,
82,4.0,13.0,Carrie,If one more person asks me that today.,
83,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"I mean, I'm not in a relationship with the father of the baby or anything.",
84,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"I've rarely heard that used as a plus, but go on.",
85,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"It’s just. Is it tacky? And beyond tacky, is it safe? Let's assume he's a really great fuck.",
86,4.0,13.0,Carrie,Because so many men are.,
87,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"Could all that poking shake the baby loose or something? No, that's silly. Married couples have sex all the time. But what if he's huge?",
88,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Again, 'cause so many men are.",
89,4.0,13.0,Miranda,- Could the dick dent the baby? ,
90,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- Where do you think dimples come from?,
91,4.0,13.0,Miranda,- That is so cute. ,
92,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- I try.,
93,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"Okay, I really need to have sex with him now. Next time he comes back in town, I'll be too big and he won't want to. Nothing puts a man off sex like pregnancy. This is my last chance. Last chance for sex.",
94,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- You're not on death row. ,
95,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"- Yes, I am, dead woman fucking.",
96,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"It’s your body, your life. You do what's best for you.",
97,4.0,13.0,Miranda,Easier said than done. You should’ve aske Aidan not to talk when you walk in the front door.,
98,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Hi, Mrs. Cohen! Hold on a second. Here, let me help you. Hold on, here we go. Hello. Okay?",
99,4.0,13.0,Mrs. Cohen,That's a crazy outfit.,
100,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"- Okay, Mrs. Cohen, this is my friend, Miranda. ",
101,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"- Hello, Mrs. Cohen.",
102,4.0,13.0,Mrs. Cohen,"Listen, you tell your boy I'm not leaving for 30 days.",
103,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- What? But we're closing in a week. ,
104,4.0,13.0,Mrs. Cohen,- Read the contract!,
105,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"I didn't think Mrs. Cohen could move any slower, but apparently she could.",
106,4.0,13.0,Aidan,"Gal, what's up? Where you been? What do you know?",
107,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Brace yourself, partner. I been outside, and what's up is Old Lightning Rod next door informs me she will not be leaving for 30 days.",
108,4.0,13.0,Aidan,I was afraid she was gonna do that. Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck are we gonna fucking do now?,
109,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Thank you. You hate it, too, I'm so relieved! I thought you'd already changed into a pod. Invasion of the Single Snatchers.",
110,4.0,13.0,Aidan,"Of course I hate it. We cannot live like this. I mean, I got all my boxes in the hall. You can't get in the fucking door.",
111,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"I know, did you see me? Every time! Every single time!",
112,4.0,13.0,Aidan,We gotta get this stuff out of here. We could make some room for it if we cleaned out your closet.,
113,4.0,13.0,Carrie,Careful!,
114,4.0,13.0,Aidan,"Okay, damn, my ears.",
115,4.0,13.0,Carrie,Listen to me. I have laid out clean towels on the floor of the bathroom. Gently place the shoes and boxes on them. I forgot I had these. Things are looking up.,
116,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- How many pairs of shoes does one person need? ,
117,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- That is not the way to get out of this alive.,
118,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- I figure I'm gonna need about half this space. ,
119,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- I figure you've gone mentally ill.,
120,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- You never wear most of this stuff. ,
121,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- Yet! I never wear most of this stuff yet. Someday I will.,
122,4.0,13.0,Aidan,Like this? When and where were you planning to wear this?,
123,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Don't do that. Don't mock the clothes. And for the record, have worn it. December, '99, Union Square, book signing.",
124,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- We gotta start somewhere. ,
125,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"- Come on, I love this outfit.",
126,4.0,13.0,Carrie,That's when I realized I was holding on to a Roberto Cavalla outfit and throwing away my relationship.,
127,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"- Okay, it goes! ",
128,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- Good.,
129,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Bye. Pete! Hey, Pete! Stop it! Pete, stop it! Pete, my God! Pete, hey! Don't show it to me, don't even show it to me! I think I saw turquoise. That better not be the pair I think! Goddamn it! That dog owes me $380.",
130,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- Fine. ,
131,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"- You can't buy it, it's circa 1996! Goddamn it!",
132,4.0,13.0,Aidan,"He's a dog, what's he supposed to do? All your shit lying around here?",
133,4.0,13.0,Carrie,My shit wouldn't be lying around if we weren't making room because your shit is lying around.,
134,4.0,13.0,Aidan,You got more shit lying around than I got lying around.,
135,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"What? Look at this place. It’s loaded with your shit. Just look at this bathroom! Look at all your shit in my bathroom. Who needs five almost empty Speed stick deodorants? What are you, a crazy bag man?",
136,4.0,13.0,Aidan,They're different smells!,
137,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"And when have you ever worn musk? Look at this stuff, you got old razors, Rogaine. Wait a minute. You use Rogaine? I didn't know you needed.",
138,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- It’s preventative! ,
139,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- Is your hair falling out? ,
140,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- I don't want to talk about it!,
141,4.0,13.0,Carrie,It seems it's not only women who have Secret Single Behavior.,
142,4.0,13.0,Carrie,This is my stuff! Don't be going through my stuff.,
143,4.0,13.0,Aidan,You were more than happy to go through my stuff.,
144,4.0,13.0,Aidan,"Your stuff, your bathroom. You always do that, you never want to let me in.",
145,4.0,13.0,Carrie,I don't ''always do'' anything. And I have let you in.,
146,4.0,13.0,Aidan,You're fighting with me about a stupid fucking outfit!,
147,4.0,13.0,Carrie,Shut up! It’s Roberto Cavalli. I threw it away and I love it! What more do you want?,
148,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- Shut up! Shut up! ,
149,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"- Yes, shut up! ",
150,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- You're telling me to shut up?,
151,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Please, just shut up! I'm so sick of hearing you talking all the time! Don't you ever just shut up?",
152,4.0,13.0,Aidan,I'm gonna take a walk.,
153,4.0,13.0,Carrie,No. I'm taking a walk! You can stay here with your boxes of shit and your shoe eating dog and you can knock yourself out putting on the Rogaine and the Speed stick! This is why I need a second door! I heard that!,
154,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"I used to think those people who sat alone at Starbucks writing on their laptops were pretentious poseurs. Now, I know. They're people who have recently moved in with someone. As I Looked around I wondered how many of them were mid-fight like myself. The hard thing about fighting in relationships, as opposed to Madison Square Garden, no referee. There's no one to tell you which comments are below the belt or when to go to your separate corners. As a result, someone usually gets hurt. And it seems, the closer a couple gets and the more ''stuff'' they have between them, the harder it is to figure out exactly why they are yelling. When it comes to relationships I couldn't help but wonder what are we fighting for?",
155,4.0,13.0,Trey,"- Hello, my darling. I'm home! ",
156,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,- What are you... is that a surprise for me?,
157,4.0,13.0,Trey,"- Yes, it is. Don't get all excited, it's just a little silly something. ",
158,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,- What is it?,
159,4.0,13.0,Trey,"Open it. It’s a cardboard baby. I saw it in the window of a novelty store next to the hospital. See, now we can relax because we have one. Oh, dear. It was supposed to be funny. I thought we'd have a chuckle.",
160,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,- Don't talk to me. ,
161,4.0,13.0,Trey,"- See, it was a novelty store. And the clerk said that they sell…",
162,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"But to Charlotte, it was definitely hitting below the belt.",
163,4.0,13.0,(TV chatter),If the meat is about a quarter of an inch thick…,
164,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"And across town, Miranda decided it was time to put on the gloves and come out swinging.",
165,4.0,13.0,Walker,Leave a message.,
166,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"Hi, Walker, Miranda. Before you leave for Brussels on Monday, how about getting together Friday night? My apartment, call me.",
167,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Pregnant or not, Miranda had needs and decided to stop fighting them.",
168,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"And surprisingly, Samantha developed some Secret Single Behavior of her own.",
169,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"Seven hours and a landside of lattes Later I vibrated home, prepared to admit how silly I'd been.",
170,4.0,13.0,Carrie,That was until he wasn't prepared to admit how silly he'd been.,
171,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"He yelled, then I yelled. It’s been three days, and nothing. Not a word. And I'll be damned if I say I'm sorry first.",
172,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,"Trey and I hardly ever yell. We're Wasps. Wasps don't yell, it's genetic. Would anyone like more salad?",
173,4.0,13.0,Miranda,"No, we're done, what's the main course?",
174,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- Relax. Chew. You'll get laid. You're not meeting until 10:00. ,
175,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,- Beef with Thai noodles.,
176,4.0,13.0,Samantha,- Richard is thinking of opening a hotel in Thailand. ,
177,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- Sweetie? It’s perfectly okay to like a guy.,
178,4.0,13.0,Samantha,"For the last time, the only thing I like about Richard is his big, throbbing, rock hard, perfect dick.",
179,4.0,13.0,Trey,- Forgot it was ladies' night. ,
180,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,"- Trey, you're not supposed to be here.",
181,4.0,13.0,Trey,"- Good evening, everyone. ",
182,4.0,13.0,Miranda,- Hello. Hi.,

185,4.0,13.0,Trey,- See I was trying to make Charlotte laugh and … ,
186,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,- It’s not funny!,
187,4.0,13.0,Trey,"Wait a minute now, maybe they'll think it's funny. See, we were so tense about not being able to have one that I gave Charlotte a cardboard baby. Isn’t that funny? Carrie, you're funny. Cardboard baby, that's funny, right? I mean, it's not funny ''haha,'' but silly. See, they sell them in novelty stores and other people buy them, and the clerk said that it was funny. Maybe you have to see it.",
188,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,- Don't you bring that thing in here! ,
189,4.0,13.0,Trey,- It’s silly.,
190,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,"Not to me it isn't! How would you feel if I gave you a cardboard cut out of a big flaccid penis? It’s not so funny now, is it? Don't you bring that flat baby in here, I will kill you!",
191,4.0,13.0,Trey,How dare you talk to me like that in front of them?,
192,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,They know about your penis problems! They're sick of hearing it!,
193,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"There we were, right in the middle of a Wasp nest.",
194,4.0,13.0,Trey,This is unforgivable!,
195,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,"No, what's unforgivable is you denying me my baby because of your own selfish, spoiled needs.",
196,4.0,13.0,Trey,- I'm spoiled? ,
197,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,- Yes!,
198,4.0,13.0,Trey,"You are spoiled! Ever since we moved back in here, it's been nothing but ''baby, baby''! What about me?",
199,4.0,13.0,Samantha,"Richard, hello. No, it's not too late to call.",
200,4.0,13.0,Charlotte,- Everything but a baby! ,
201,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- We're gonna go.,
202,4.0,13.0,Trey,- Good! ,

209,4.0,13.0,Samantha,"- Okay, what's so important that it couldn't wait until… ",
210,4.0,13.0,Richard,- This.,
211,4.0,13.0,Samantha,Let's get something straight. I want no part of that. That turns everything into a big screaming mess. We are work and sex. Nothing more. Now kindly take off those pants and show me your dick.,
212,4.0,13.0,Richard,- I'll show you mine if you show me yours. ,
213,4.0,13.0,Samantha,- That's what I'm talking about.,
214,4.0,13.0,Carrie,Seeing a bantam-weight championship fight like Charlotte and Trey's made me thankful that Aidan and I were still in the banter-weight division.,
215,4.0,13.0,Carrie,- I’ m sorry. ,

230,4.0,13.0,Aidan,- What?,
231,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"I've never lived with anybody before you, so I don't know how to say this correctly but I need you to not talk to me for one whole hour. I know that sounds pretty selfish but it's just what I need. Is that okay? Okay, good. We don't have any other rooms yet, so I'm gonna close these and then it's like I'm not here. For one whole hour, I'm not here. Thanks. I love you.",
232,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"So, what are you doing out here?",
233,4.0,13.0,Carrie,"That's the thing about needs, sometimes when you get them met, you don't need them anymore.",

2,4.0,14.0,Aidan,"Those floors next door, they were in worse shape than yours.",
3,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"You want me to see if I can get us into Town? You know that restaurant in the Chambers hotel, with the period in the name, Town period. It’s supposed to be amazing. Exclamation point.",
4,4.0,14.0,Aidan,- You know what sounds amazing to me? ,
5,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- What?,
6,4.0,14.0,Aidan,"Nice hot shower, watching the game. Bucket of K.F.C. Mashed potaters, biscuits.",
7,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- But it's Saturday night. ,
8,4.0,14.0,Aidan,"- It’s finger licking good. K period, F period, C period.",
9,4.0,14.0,Samantha,It’s about fucking time. Get over here and do me!,
10,4.0,14.0,Carrie,Is that your standard greeting now?,
11,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"Sorry, I thought it was Richard. That asshole said he'd call in five minutes. That was four hours ago. I've been waiting by the phone.",
12,4.0,14.0,Carrie,My dinner might be arriving in a bucket. You want to go out?,
13,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- Immediately. I'll conference the other girls.,
14,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- You know how to do that?,
15,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- How else do you have three-way phone sex?,
16,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- hello?,
17,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- What are you doing?,
18,4.0,14.0,Trey,- MacDougal residence. ,
19,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- It's for me! I’ve got it. ,
20,4.0,14.0,Trey,- Good for you!,
21,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,It’s the first time we talked today.,
22,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- Hello? ,
23,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- We're going out.,
24,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- Who's on the phone? ,
25,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- All of us. It’s the future.,
26,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- Why are you guys calling me so late? ,
27,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- It’s 7:30, were you asleep?",
28,4.0,14.0,Miranda,I'm pregnant. I'm always asleep. These are my last months of freedom. I'm spending them in bed.,
29,4.0,14.0,Samantha,Don't spend them alone in bed.,
30,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"I'm a lost cause, go on without me, save yourselves!",
31,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"No, we're all going. We have to shake things up before we officially become boring.",
32,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- I say we go dancing. ,
33,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- I'm in. ,
34,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- Let's go dancing!,
35,4.0,14.0,Miranda,Not where I'd feel worse when no one's interested because I'm fat.,
36,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- You're not. You're pregnant. ,
37,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"- Yeah, that’ll have men lining up at the door.",
38,4.0,14.0,Samantha,I know exactly where we should go.,
39,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"That night we finally answered the age old question: ''Where are all the hot guys?'' Well, the hot gay guys. They were at the hot gay club, Trade.",
40,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- I feel like we don't belong here. ,
41,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- That's because we're wearing shirts.,
42,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"Seriously, why don't straight men have bodies like this?",
43,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Because gay men have the possibility of sex at the gym. If straight men had that they'd be working out all the time, too.",
44,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- I've had sex at the gym. ,
45,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Samantha is doing her part to motivate the masses.,
46,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- I'm going to the ladies' room. ,
47,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"- Me, too, I bet there's no line.",
48,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Wait. We'll meet you at the bar? ,
49,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- At the bar.,
50,4.0,14.0,Anthony,- Char! ,
51,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"- My God, it's Anthony! Hi!",
52,4.0,14.0,Anthony,"Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?",
53,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- We're shaking things up. You remember Carrie? ,
54,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Hi!,
55,4.0,14.0,Anthony,- Love what you're almost wearing. ,
56,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"- Sister, Day-Glo Underwear, look into it.",
57,4.0,14.0,Anthony,Are we gonna dance?,
58,4.0,14.0,Anthony,"This is my friend, Gordon. He's a design editor for House and Garden.",
59,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,My God! I love that magazine! I used to wear my mother's pearls and flip through it when I was little.,
60,4.0,14.0,Gordon,"Me, too.",
61,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"I've got a great before apartment, if you're looking for an after.",
62,4.0,14.0,Anthony,"You should see Char's apartment. It’s Park Avenue, it's so frieaking gorgeous.",
63,4.0,14.0,Gordon,We're doing an urban issue this spring. Maybe I should check it out.,
64,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,My God! If my apartment could be in H and G magazine I would be in heaven!,
65,4.0,14.0,Gordon,- You are pretty. You want to dance? ,
66,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- Okay. So how long have you worked there?,
67,4.0,14.0,Anthony,"- Swell, I get him all wound up, she cashes in. ",
68,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Are you two together?,
69,4.0,14.0,Anthony,"- No, but I'm hoping we will be around 3:30. ",
70,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- You're dirty.,
71,4.0,14.0,Anthony,- Dance? ,
72,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- No, I'm good. You kids go have fun.",
73,4.0,14.0,Anthony,- Okay. ,
74,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Okay.,
75,4.0,14.0,Anthony,- Watch out for the fairy. ,
76,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Which one?,
77,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"Attention gentlemen, ladies present!",
78,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"Sorry. There's no ladies' room, because… Yeah, Excuse me. Thanks.",
79,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"Don't mind me, fellas. Just looking. Kinda like being a diabetic at Baskin Robbins.",
80,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Sir? Hello! Excuse me! Over here. Hello, anybody!",
81,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- What do you need? ,
82,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- A penis, evidently. I'm trying to order a dirty martini.",
83,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"- Kurt, a dirty martini for the lovely and talented Carrie Bradshaw. ",
84,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Thank you.,
85,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- Oliver Spencer.,
86,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Hello.,
87,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"I've only been in the States six months, and regard your column as my New York survival guide.",
88,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Oliver, you're a dead man. I have no idea what I'm talking about. What do you do?",
89,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- I'm a shoe distributor. ,
90,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- It would be cruel to kid me.,
91,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"- All the top lines. Offices here, Sydney, and Milan. ",
92,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- So, then you get a discount?",
93,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- For special friends and columnists. ,
94,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Thank you. Cheers!,
95,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"- Cheers to you! Hello, what's this? ",
96,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- What?,
97,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- That. ,
98,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- Oh, this. I keep forgetting I'm engaged.",
99,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"- You can't go off the market, you're my dating guru. ",
100,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- I'm still allowed to see other gays.,
101,4.0,14.0,Oliver,You must allow me to take you to brunch. I'll give you my card. Can you hold this for a moment?,
102,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Sure. What's this, a goody bag?",
103,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"- Of course, I was at a film release party earlier. ",
104,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Jox and Cocks Four.,
105,4.0,14.0,Oliver,I was told it's a Merchant Ivory film.,
106,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Would I be able to enjoy this if I missed Jox and Cocks One, Two and Three?",
107,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"Yes, but you'd want to see those eventually. Very important films.",
108,4.0,14.0,Miranda,Max! Hi!,
109,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Max was a junior associate at Miranda's law firm and, apparently, gay.",
110,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- I had no idea. ,
111,4.0,14.0,Max,- I had no idea you were a gay man either!,
112,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"I'm here with friends. And there's no ladies' room, because… yeah.",
113,4.0,14.0,Max,"Yeah. Listen, Miranda, I'd kind of prefer if we didn't make an issue out of this at work. I'm not in the closet. I just wouldn't want the older partners to start treating me differently, so…",
114,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"I totally understand. And between you and me, I'm pregnant.",
115,4.0,14.0,Max,And unwed. Perhaps you should spend less time in gay clubs. Seriously good for you.,
116,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"Remains to be seen. Anyhow, I haven't told anybody at work, because goodbye to all the good cases and then it's only a matter of time before the buzzards start vying for my office.",
117,4.0,14.0,Max,It is a very nice office.,
118,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- I'm coming here every week! ,
119,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- Excuse me. What did I miss?,
120,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- I peed in a men's room and outed a coworker. ,
121,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- I got a phone number and some porn.,
122,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- I saw two dicks and took a hit of ''X.'' ,
123,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- To think that I almost slept through this.,
124,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,I can't believe you took ecstasy from a stranger.,
125,4.0,14.0,Samantha,He wasn't a stranger! He's a friend of my friend Bobby's friend Bobby.,
126,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"Then, you know it's safe. Will we be going to a rave later?",
127,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"No, but I might have to drop in on Richard. Sex on ''X'' is supposed to be amazing. It releases all of your inhibitions.",
128,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,You have inhibitions?,
129,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- My God, look. ",
130,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- Three dicks and counting!,
131,4.0,14.0,Carrie,They say opposites attract. What they fail to mention is that opposites also tend to have opposite views on what constitutes a rockin' Saturday night.,
132,4.0,14.0,Aidan,How was your night?,
133,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"I've got a goody bag. Know what's in it? C'mon, I had to fight a foreigner for it.",
134,4.0,14.0,Aidan,Come here. Just tuck in here and let's go to sleep.,
135,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- I'm not tired yet. ,
136,4.0,14.0,Aidan,- You will be.,
137,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Hey you, I had five Cocktails. I danced with a lot of fine half naked men. If you would wake up right now I can almost guarantee you'd be in for some FUN.",
138,4.0,14.0,Aidan,"I ate too much chicken, I think. Will you rub my belly, baby?",
139,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"I know it was wrong to compare but I felt like I had spent the evening in a Calvin Klein ad and now I was back to baseball, buckets, and BVDs.",
140,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Samantha was having excellent sex.",
141,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"That was amazing. You are amazing. I love you, Richard. I am in love with you.",
142,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- You told him you loved him? ,
143,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- It was the ''X'' talking! All I wanted to do was to have sex!,
144,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- Okay, and then what did he say? ",
145,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"- Nothing, he just went to sleep.",
146,4.0,14.0,Carrie,Is it possible he didn't hear you?,
147,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"He heard me. Can I get a fucking cab? If he was any kind of gentleman at all, he'd pretend it never happened.",
148,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- But you did have sex, right? ",
149,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- Of course we had sex.,
150,4.0,14.0,Carrie,Aidan and I didn't. He fell asleep and I watched gay porn.,
151,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"See, that's what happens when people say, ''I love you!''",
152,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Do you love him? ,
153,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- Who the hell knows? ,
154,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Maybe the ''X'' knows.,
155,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"It makes you giddy. I was in love with the Taxi driver, the doorman, his sweater.",
156,4.0,14.0,Carrie,But you only said it to Richard.,
157,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"I am never taking ''X'' again. It is a dangerous, dangerous drug.",
158,4.0,14.0,Carrie,That afternoon I was high on another feel good drug: the new gay friend.,
159,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- Could you be more fantastic? ,
160,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- They say you can't meet men in bars.,
161,4.0,14.0,Oliver,That was true for me last night. I went to Trade hoping to meet someone for just a shag because I've a boyfriend in Sydney. And the only person I met was you. Not that I'm disappointed.,
162,4.0,14.0,Carrie,And your boyfriend doesn't mind if you date other men?,
163,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"- Not date, have sex with. ",
164,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- Right, the international gay rules.",
165,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"Absolutely. Blow jobs only, no last names. The gym is a free space and never ever show up at the same place wearing the same shirt. I just crossed over into a whole other set of rules.",
166,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"You've certainly worked out more options than ''Till death do us part.'' That's all we've come up with, and frankly, I find it a little limiting.",
167,4.0,14.0,Oliver,I know gay couples who are monogamous. But I'm a realist. I don't expect to get everything from one man. But I guess I shouldn't be saying this to someone wearing a ring.,
168,4.0,14.0,Carrie,What's with you and this ring?,
169,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- What's with you and the ring? You haven't even mentioned him. ,
170,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Aidan.,
171,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- What's Aidan like? ,
172,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- He's very tall and incredibly kind. And handsome.,
173,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"So, why would you leave that at home on a Saturday night?",
174,4.0,14.0,Carrie,He wanted to stay in and listen to sports with a bucket of chicken.,
175,4.0,14.0,Oliver,He would have made my dad so proud. Have you been to Bungalow Eight yet?,
176,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"No. But I hear it's a pretentious, members only, tiny, crowded club that you need a key to get into.",
177,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- I have a key. ,
178,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- When are we going?,
179,4.0,14.0,Stanford,- If it isn't little Carrie Bradshaw. ,
180,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Young Stanford! How are you?,
181,4.0,14.0,Stanford,"- At the moment, confused. Who's this? ",
182,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- Oliver Spencer, Stanford Blatch.",
183,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"Pleasure to meet you. I don't mean to be rude, but I must go to the men's room.",
184,4.0,14.0,Stanford,"- I've just been, you'll love it. ",
185,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- Really?,
186,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- I'll be right here. ,
187,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- I'll be right back.,
188,4.0,14.0,Stanford,- So? ,
189,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Yes?,
190,4.0,14.0,Oliver,I saw the way you were behaving. You're sleeping with the beautiful man.,
191,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- The beautiful man is gay. ,
192,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- Damn! An accent always throws me.,
193,4.0,14.0,Carrie,He's only been in New York for about six months. I picked him up at Trade.,
194,4.0,14.0,Stanford,You went to shirtless heaven without me?,
195,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- It wasn't the same. ,
196,4.0,14.0,Stanford,- I was prepared to lose you to Aidan. But this…,
197,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Is just brunch. ,
198,4.0,14.0,Stanford,- I'm green with envy. ,
199,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- Yes, you are.",
200,4.0,14.0,Stanford,"Fine! Have your beautiful brunch with your beautiful man and then go home to your other beautiful man. Greedy, greedy, greedy.",
201,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Later, I started to think about restlessness and relationships. Once we found what we've been searching for, why are some of us reluctant to let go of our single selves? Is single life in New York such a constant flurry of fun and friends that settling down immediately fills us with the urge to shake things up again? And why does becoming part of a couple imply settling down? Maybe Oliver does have the key. We shouldn't expect to get everything from one man but instead, feel comfortable getting different things from different people. Although, at what point do separate interests become separate bedrooms? I couldn't help but wonder, to be in a couple do you have to put your single self on a shelf?",
202,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Miranda's workaholic single self was a thing of the past. Now, she was sleeping for two.",
203,4.0,14.0,Celeste,"It’s finally happening. Stern, Hawkins, Erickson is moving into the future.",
204,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"Excuse me, what? We're moving?",
205,4.0,14.0,Celeste,"Casual Friday. The entire partnership finally okayed it, finally. I've been working on this for what, two years now?",
206,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"- Right, great. ",
207,4.0,14.0,Celeste,"- Yeah, Thanks. And congratulations.",
208,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- Did you tell Celeste I was pregnant?,
209,4.0,14.0,Max,"- Okay, yes, but only in your defense. ",
210,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- What?,
211,4.0,14.0,Max,"This morning she was telling everyone how she saw you sleeping on your desk a couple of times, that you might be an alcoholic, bipolar, or something.",
212,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- You told her I was pregnant?,
213,4.0,14.0,Max,- Isn’t that better?,
214,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"- No, not at a law firm, no. ",
215,4.0,14.0,Max,"- Sorry, I told her it was a secret.",
216,4.0,14.0,Miranda,She can't keep a secret. She's probably told everybody in the office by now. How would you like it if I told everybody in the office that you were gay?,
217,4.0,14.0,Celeste,- Casual Friday has arrived.,
218,4.0,14.0,Max,- Great. Maybe next you can call my grandparents.,
219,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- This is gay porn. ,
220,4.0,14.0,Miranda,- What was your first clue?,
221,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,You said we were watching an independent film. I brought biscotti.,
222,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Relax, I've watched it already, and I'm telling you, this is really funny.",
223,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"See, that's the way to do it. No ''I love you,'' just good old-fashioned fucking.",
224,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- I am not in the mood for gay porn. ,
225,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- Not in the mood for gay porn?,
226,4.0,14.0,Miranda,Don't you want to know how it ends?,
227,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,House and Garden wants to shoot my apartment. I told Trey and he doesn't care.,
228,4.0,14.0,Miranda,We turned off porn to talk about a magazine? ,
229,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"Biscotti, please.",
230,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,He never cares about what I want. Anthony is more excited about it than Trey is.,
231,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"That's because gay men understand what's important. Clothes, compliments, and Cocks. And clubs.",
232,4.0,14.0,Carrie,Oliver's taking me to Bungalow Eight tomorrow night.,
233,4.0,14.0,Miranda,Sounds like you're cheating on Aidan with a gay man.,
234,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"No, that's allowed. Gay boyfriends are the loophole of monogamy.",
235,4.0,14.0,Miranda,"My gay boyfriend outed me at work, then I outed him. Even my gay relationships are dysfunctional.",
236,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Okay, here's the problem. Aidan loves to stay in, and I love to go out.",
237,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,And he's fine with that.,
238,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"It’s either the greatest relationship ever, or we're headed…",
239,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"For separate bedrooms, like me. We're in completely different places. Trey's content with what we have. Therefore, I am a bad person for needing to have a baby.",
240,4.0,14.0,Carrie,You're not a bad person. You're a person with needs.,
241,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- This is making me depressed. Let's watch that movie. ,
242,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- I thought you'd never ask.,
243,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"The next morning, Samantha and Richard were taking care of business, but not each other.",
244,4.0,14.0,Richard,I'm not doing any more charity crap if we can't get publicity. Steve Martin was there and he's the toast of New York.,
245,4.0,14.0,Samantha,He's the toast of The New Yorker. There's a difference. Are we gonna talk about this?,
246,4.0,14.0,Richard,- About what? ,
247,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- That thing I said the other night.,
248,4.0,14.0,Richard,"- Samantha, you were high on ''X.'' Believe me, I've been there. ",
249,4.0,14.0,Samantha,"- Oh! Good. Okay, then.",
250,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Once Richard made it clear that her ''I love you'' didn't matter, Samantha realized she was secretly wishing it did.",
251,4.0,14.0,Richard,"- So, you'll yell at The Times? ",
252,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- I already did.,
253,4.0,14.0,Richard,- Did you need something else? ,
254,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- No.,
255,4.0,14.0,Carrie,She wanted to tell him it wasn't just the drug talking that night. But she put her real feelings on the shelf.,
256,4.0,14.0,Samantha,- Fuck you at my place around 8:00? ,
257,4.0,14.0,Richard,- Sounds good.,
258,4.0,14.0,Carrie,Charlotte and Trey's separate interests had become more than separate bedrooms. They'd become a real separation. ,
259,4.0,14.0,Trey,Pretty.,
260,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,They're for the photo shoot tomorrow. They're coming at 10:00. Would you please move your stuff out of the guest room?,
261,4.0,14.0,Trey,Are they photographing the guest room?,
262,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,I don't know. But it doesn't look very good with us sleeping in separate bedrooms.,
263,4.0,14.0,Trey,"- No, it doesn't, does it? ",
264,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"- They want us to dress nicely, but not too formal.",
265,4.0,14.0,Trey,- I'm in the picture? ,
266,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- They want to photograph both of us. ,
267,4.0,14.0,Trey,- Why?,
268,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"Because they think we're the perfect couple. I know. But I promised, and they're coming.",
269,4.0,14.0,Trey,- I don't want to do this. ,
270,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"- It's just one picture, and it's important to me.",
271,4.0,14.0,Trey,"No, this. I don't want to do this anymore. You are so angry at me.",
272,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"I'm sorry. I want a baby. I thought that's what you wanted, too.",
273,4.0,14.0,Trey,- So did l. ,
274,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- I don't think I should have to give that up.,
275,4.0,14.0,Trey,- You shouldn't. You can have the apartment. I'll move back in with mother. ,
276,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- Okay.,
277,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Charlotte and Trey's separate interests had become more than separate bedrooms. They'd become a real separation. Meanwhile, I tried to find a way for my single self and my couple self to co-exist.",
278,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, I tried to find a way for my single self and my couple self to co-exist.",
279,4.0,14.0,Aiden,There you go. Yowza! Where are you going all dressed up like that?,
280,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- I told you yesterday I was going out. ,
281,4.0,14.0,Aiden,- You didn't say you were going all out.,
282,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- I have to see Bungalow Eight. ,
283,4.0,14.0,Aiden,"- Yeah, what's that, a play?",
284,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"No, it's a very hot club. It’s important that I know about these things. Some people consider my column the New York survival guide.",
285,4.0,14.0,Aiden,- What's going on here? ,
286,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- It’s just something I'm trying. It’s closer to my heart this way.,
287,4.0,14.0,Aiden,"- Who are you going out with, the girls?",
288,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- This guy, Oliver Spencer.",
289,4.0,14.0,Aiden,- A guy? ,
290,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- He's gay.,
291,4.0,14.0,Aiden,"Cool. Listen, I am done for the night. So, you want me to jump in the shower, come with?",
292,4.0,14.0,Carrie,I don't know. I don't know if he can get us both in.,
293,4.0,14.0,Aiden,- What do you mean? We can get in anywhere. ,
294,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- You need a key or something.,
295,4.0,14.0,Aiden,- A key? Give me a fuckin' break. ,
296,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- See, that kind of attitude is not appreciated at Bungalow Eight.",
297,4.0,14.0,Aiden,"Come on, a key? Why do you even buy into that shit? Let's just go out to dinner, I haven't seen you all week.",
298,4.0,14.0,Carrie,I can't. I told Oliver…,
299,4.0,14.0,Aiden,"All right. Don't forget your key, because we're very exclusive here, and we might not let you back in.",
300,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"See, now I feel bad. I basically discouraged him from coming.",
301,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- Call and have him join us. ,
302,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- This is so not his scene.,
303,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"Then you have to break it off. This is Bungalow Eight, darling!",
304,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Right, what's a relationship compared to a night with trendy strangers?",
305,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- Oliver Spencer and date. ,
306,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- I'm your date?,
307,4.0,14.0,Carrie,Turns out there's one problem with having a handsome gay man as your date. Other handsome gay men.,
308,4.0,14.0,Man,- I just love those new Prada open toed sandals. ,
309,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- I think I can get you a pair of those.,
310,4.0,14.0,Man,- Really? ,
311,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- What size? ,
312,4.0,14.0,Man,- Eleven.,
313,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"So, Ollie? Is there anything to eat at Bungalow Eight? Or is food so very last year? Okay, it seems you're in the middle of a spa session, so…",
314,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"Wait, you're going?",
315,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"You know, I left a gorgeous man at home to come here and be your date. And I'm guessing size 11 did as well. So, I'm just not really sure why I'm here.",
316,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"Because you're fantastic, and I'm sorry I was neglecting you. I'm very bad. Kiss and make up?",
317,4.0,14.0,Stanford ,If it isn't Mr. and Mrs. Down Under.,
318,4.0,14.0,Carrie,I was so preoccupied with my gay boyfriend I kept forgetting about my gay husband.,
319,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- You remember Stanford, from brunch? ",
320,4.0,14.0,Stanford,"- Apparently, it was more than just brunch.",
321,4.0,14.0,Stanford ,"Don't fall for him, he's just another pretty face. He doesn't love you like I do. I knew this woman when she took the subway and wore candies.",
322,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- Candies? ,
323,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- I assure you, I never wore candies.",
324,4.0,14.0,Stanford ,"You wore pink suede candies, and I adored you anyway. And how dare you try to steal her away with your dreamy eyes and your probably fake accent?",
325,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- I'm sorry; I didn't realize the lady was spoken for. ,
326,4.0,14.0,Stanford ,- She is.,
327,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"- All right, then. ",
328,4.0,14.0,Oliver,- Kiss and make up?,
329,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"And then I realized, my single self life had a shelf life, and it had just expired.",
330,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- Okay, I'm going. ",
331,4.0,14.0,Oliver,"- No, Carrie, stay. We only just got here. Let me buy you another drink.",
332,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"No, it's fine, I just want to go home.",
333,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"And the surprising thing was, I did.",
334,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- Honey, I'm home. ",
335,4.0,14.0,Aiden,- How was the Bungalow?,
336,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- I've seen better. ,
337,4.0,14.0,Aiden,- Why do you own Jox and Cocks Four?,
338,4.0,14.0,Carrie,- More research for the survival guide? ,
339,4.0,14.0,Aiden,- Really? What did you learn?,
340,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"- Oh, yeah. Give me some of that. ",
341,4.0,14.0,Aiden,- A big Thank you to our gay friends.,
342,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"That's the thing about Manhattan. The most exclusive clubs only have a couple members and they're very hard to find. The next morning, House and Garden came to Charlotte's house.",
343,4.0,14.0,Anthony,"It’s fork, fork, knife, spoon. What are these people, crazy?",
344,4.0,14.0,Gordon,- This is perfect. It's very Upper East Side breakfast for two. I love this china. ,
345,4.0,14.0,Anthony ,"- Me, too.",
346,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"Thanks, it's our wedding china. Anthony, can I talk to you a minute?",
347,4.0,14.0,Anthony,We'll be right back. Is he cute or what?,
348,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,- Trey and I… ,
349,4.0,14.0,Anthony,"- Splitting up, I knew it.",
350,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"Anyway I don't think he's gonna be in the picture. So, should we just cancel?",
351,4.0,14.0,Anthony,"Cancel? H and G, House and Garden? Do it without him.",
352,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"Won't that look bad, just me?",
353,4.0,14.0,Anthony,"It’ll look beautiful. He may be the heart surgeon. But you're the heart of this whole operation. Honestly, you're the best catch ever. Look what you did to this place. You could take any guy off the street, fix him up and make him into something wonderful. Not for nothing. But you deserve more than that stick-up-his-ass preppy. That's all I’m saying. Now get in here and have breakfast. Gordon, it's just gonna be…",
354,4.0,14.0,Trey,"- All right, we ready for the picture? ",
355,4.0,14.0,Anthony,- One minute.,
356,4.0,14.0,Charlotte,"- Trey, you don't have to… ",
357,4.0,14.0,Trey,- No. This is important to you. I at least want to do this.,
358,4.0,14.0,Gordon,"Handsome husband, beautiful wife. Having breakfast! Smile.",
359,4.0,14.0,Carrie,"Trey had moved out by the time the magazine was on the stands. But all over America, little girls in their mothers' pearls saw the picture and thought, ""That's what I want."" That's the thing about relationships. Sometimes they look prettier from the outside. And what's inside can be different than it seems.",
0,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"When a marriage breaks up, there are numerous ways to cope. You can cry. You can move.",
1,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,"It’s left right, not right left.",
2,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Or, as Charlotte did, dive into a new routine. A tap routine.",
3,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,I feel good. I even signed up for sculpture and tap dancing class.,
4,4.0,15.0,Carrie,Because you can't do one without the other.,
5,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,"And everyone keeps telling me to take time to grieve. I don't need time. This divorce is going to be clean and swift, like pulling off a Band-Aid.",
6,4.0,15.0,Susan Sharon,"Carrie! My God, I thought that was you.",
7,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"There it was, the unmistakable voice of Susan Sharon.",
8,4.0,15.0,Susan Sharon,What's new? What's going on with you?,
9,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Same old, same old. Just writing, gallivanting, eating. You know, the usual.",
10,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,- Carrie! ,
11,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- What?,
12,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,You're forgetting the most important thing. They're engaged!,
13,4.0,15.0,Carrie,I'm engaged!,
14,4.0,15.0,Susan Sharon,"You're getting married! My God! Aidan! Okay. Let me see, where's the…",
15,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"It’s here, it's right here.",
16,4.0,15.0,Susan Sharon,Why is it around your neck? Is that what the people are doing these days? I'm so out of it.,
17,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"No, it's just me. It’s closer to my heart this way.",
18,4.0,15.0,Susan Sharon,"So, spring wedding? Fall wedding? Where are you doing it?",
19,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"God, we haven't even begun to think about that stuff.",
20,4.0,15.0,Susan Sharon,"You'd better chop chop, missy. Because these places book up, I'm telling you, years and years. Okay, anyway, the wedding.",
21,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"The next morning, a hotel mogul and his publicist began another grueling day at work.",
22,4.0,15.0,Samantha,- Can I help you? ,
23,4.0,15.0,Richard,- You're gorgeous. ,
24,4.0,15.0,Samantha,- Tell me something I don't know.,
25,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"As intimate as their personal affair had become, when it came to their business affairs, Samantha remained cool and professional, in theory.",
26,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,J.J. Mitchell.,
27,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"J.J., Samantha Jones. I have your column in my hand and I'm very disappointed.",x
28,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,"Jonesy, I thought you'd be sucking my dick for getting Richard's name in the paper.",
29,4.0,15.0,Samantha,We'll talk about your dick in a second. Richard canoodling with Bebe London? That's bullshit. I know he's canoodling with one woman and it's not Bebe London.,
30,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,"Okay, guess which hotheaded publicist can't seem to keep track of her own client?",
31,4.0,15.0,Samantha,Guess which two-bit gossip columnist is talking out of his ass?,
32,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,"Believe me, I'd rather be talking out of your ass. So, just say the word… Jonesy?",
33,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"J.J. Mitchell's column said you were canoodling with Bebe London. He's an idiot, just giving you a heads-up.",
34,4.0,15.0,Richard,"- All press is good press, right? ",
35,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"- So, you were canoodling with Bebe London?",
36,4.0,15.0,Richard,- Is that a problem? ,
37,4.0,15.0,Samantha,- No. I just need to get all the facts so I can do my job.,
38,4.0,15.0,Richard,Why don't you take a break from your job and get that sexy ass in here?,
39,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"In an effort to drown out thoughts of Richard canoodling with Bebe London, Samantha focused on her own caboodle.",
40,4.0,15.0,Carrie,And in a more modest shower uptown…,
41,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Excuse me, have we met?",
42,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"Can I get in there? The Sheetrock guy is coming in 10 minutes. It’s really coming along over there. Walls are coming down, washer dryer's on the way.",
43,4.0,15.0,Carrie,I forgot about the washer and dryer. I've been dreaming of that my whole New York life.,
44,4.0,15.0,Aidan,Here's something else for you to chew on.,
45,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- What's that? ,
46,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- How about Hawaii?,
47,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"As what, the 50th state?",
48,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"As in, we get hitched. We grab a couple friends, down some mai tais, tie the knot. You know, we can get ''Maui'd.''",
49,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"- Buddy, did you just pun in the nude? ",
50,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- Yeah.,
51,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- What did I tell you about that? Give me the soap. ,
52,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- What do you think?,
53,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"- What, about Hawaii? ",
54,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- Yeah.,
55,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Come on, do I look like the ''Hang10,'' ''Surf' sup'' kind of bride to you? 'Cause I really think my grass skirt days are over.",
56,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"Okay, how about Aspen? Christmas time in Aspen. You, me, a polar bear, a judge. How's that sound?",
57,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"For a shower with so little water pressure, I suddenly felt a ton of it beating down on my shoulders.",
58,4.0,15.0,Tammy,"And here's the spine, right here. Isn’t that incredible? Here's the heart beating. See?",
59,4.0,15.0,Miranda,Kind of. I think so.,
60,4.0,15.0,Tammy,"- Okay. Do you want to know the sex? I can tell you right now, if you do. ",
61,4.0,15.0,Miranda,- Okay.,
62,4.0,15.0,Tammy,- Sure? It’s a boy. It’s a boy. How do you feel? ,
63,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"- Wow! Great, a boy! Boy, oh boy.",
64,4.0,15.0,Miranda,- I just faked a sonogram. ,
65,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- I'm sorry?,
66,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"I was lying there, the technician's giving me a guided tour of my uterus, then she tells me I'm having a boy.",
67,4.0,15.0,Carrie,My God! You're having a boy?,
68,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"You see? That. That's what this woman wanted out of me, but I couldn't get it up for her. So, I faked it.",
69,4.0,15.0,Carrie,What exactly does a fake sonogram look like in case I ever need to do it?,
70,4.0,15.0,Miranda,Everyone else is glowing about my pregnancy. When will I?,
71,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"I get the same thing every time someone hears I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be all excited about picking a date, and a place, and a theme. And I just want to lie down and take a big nap. I feel like a deadbeat bride.",
72,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"So, don't do all that stupid stuff. Fuck them.",
73,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"I better do something soon because I'm getting the distinct feeling my Grace period is OVER. I don't even want to look for a dress. Me, no dress! What's wrong here?",
74,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"Maybe it's like the dentist. You put it off and put it off, and then you finally go and afterwards you feel great.",
75,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"God, I have to go to the dentist.",
76,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"Okay, wait. I'm having a radical idea here. There's a horrible bridal shop a couple of blocks away.",
77,4.0,15.0,Miranda,We could go.,
78,4.0,15.0,Carrie,How do you even know this?,
79,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"Because every time I pass by it, I go ''blech.'' We could run in, you could try on the worst dress they have, just face the dragon, get it over with. And then I'll treat you to a Tasti Delite. It’s like aversion shock therapy.",
80,4.0,15.0,Carrie,You want me to try on a bad wedding dress? You're gonna have to do a lot better than Tasti Delite.,
81,4.0,15.0,Miranda,I'll try one on too?,
82,4.0,15.0,Carrie,Woo!,
83,4.0,15.0,Miranda,- Hi! ,
84,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Hello. ,
85,4.0,15.0,Rita,- Ladies.,
86,4.0,15.0,Carrie,My friend Miranda here is getting married. So we're looking for something special and we're in kind of a hurry.,
87,4.0,15.0,Miranda,And for Carrie here we're thinking of something with a lot of bows very frilly and poofy. We want her to look like a giant cupcake.,
88,4.0,15.0,Rita,"I'm sorry, which one of you is getting married?",
89,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"We both are. We do everything together. And right now, Miranda has everything but the gown. And the groom.",
90,4.0,15.0,Miranda,- Whoops! ,
91,4.0,15.0,Rita,- Okay. Is this a lesbian wedding?,
92,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"No, it's a very straight-laced, conservative crowd. Lots of Wall Street types.",
93,4.0,15.0,Rita,- I'll see what I can find. Come with me.,
94,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Your rehearsal dinner is gonna rock.,
95,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Okay, on the count of three. One, two…",
96,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Look at you. ,
97,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"- Stop, I'm going to pee in this thing. Look at you!",
98,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Look at yourself! ,
99,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"- Hold still, you need a veil. You need a veil.",
100,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"Look, look. I look beautiful. You can't even tell I'm pregnant in this. The sleeves balance out the tummy. Don't you think it's kind of fetching?",
101,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"My God. This is too tight, I can't breathe. Can you get it off me?",
102,4.0,15.0,Miranda,- Are you kidding? ,
103,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"- No, I'm not kidding!",
104,4.0,15.0,Miranda,You don't want the woman to come back in here.,
105,4.0,15.0,Carrie,I'm not kidding. Get it off! I'm burning up. I can't breathe!,
106,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"I'm sorry! There are a million buttons back here! My God, your back is all red.",
107,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"- Just get it off, just rip it off! ",
108,4.0,15.0,Miranda,- My God. What just happened?,
109,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"- I can't do it, I can't get married. ",
110,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,- This is all your fault.,
111,4.0,15.0,Samantha,- How could you take her to that dump? ,
112,4.0,15.0,Miranda,- it was an experiment. It went awry.,
113,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,"Okay, let's just slow down. This is classic cold feet. Let's not do anything rash.",
114,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Rash, yes exactly, rash. Look at this. My body is literally rejecting the idea of marriage. Look!",
115,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"Once you get a rash from a guy, It’s time to heave ho.",
116,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"No, it's not him, it's me. I'm missing the bride gene. I should be put in a test tube and studied.",
117,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"- It’s not just you, I don't want to get married. ",
118,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,- Ever?,
119,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Why do we even have to get married? Why? Give me one good reason. Aside from the not wanting to diea lone thing. Which is something to think about, I admit.",
120,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,"For me, when it was good, it gave me a sense of security.",
121,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"But I feel secure now. Things are great with us. You know what they say, ‘‘If it ain't broke, ''",
122,4.0,15.0,Samantha,Don't marry it.,
123,4.0,15.0,Miranda,- What are you afraid would change? ,
124,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- I don't know. Nothing. Everything.,
125,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,- Every bride feels that way at one point. ,
126,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Why aren't they speaking up?,
127,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"Carrie, I'm going to ask you an unpleasant question now. Why did you ever say yes?",
128,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Because I love him. A man you love, kneels in the street and offers you a ring, you say yes.",
129,4.0,15.0,Carrie,That's what you do.,
130,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"You get married, you hope for the best. It doesn't work out, you get divorced. You can take tap with Bo Jangles here.",
131,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"No, I can't take a vow of forever and ever, if what I mean is for the foreseeable future. I can't do that to Aidan.",
132,4.0,15.0,Miranda,Talk to him about it.,
133,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"How do you talk about this? ''Aidan, what's up? ''I've just been thinking, having some doubts about the whole 'I do' thing.'' It’ll break his heart. I should never have said yes. I'm a bad person.",
134,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"It’s amazing. in a courtroom, reasonable doubt can get you off for murder. In an engagement, it makes you feel like a bad person.",
135,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,"Look, everyone has anxiety around weddings. Maybe your anxiety threshold is just lower than other people's.",
136,4.0,15.0,Carrie,Interesting theory. You think that dress is still outside the dumpster at Tasti Delite?,
137,4.0,15.0,Carrie,After being hit by a bridal wave I tried to get my mind around the concept of happily ever after.,
138,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"As progressive as our society claims to be, there are still certain life targets we’re all supposed to hit. Marriage, babies, and a home to call your own. But what if, instead of breaking out in a smile, you break out in a rash? Is something wrong with the system? Or is it you? And do we really want these things? Or are we just programmed? In a crisis, people always tell you to listen to your gut. Mine was telling me to start smoking again.",
139,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Hi. Marlboro Lights, please.",
140,4.0,15.0,Carrie,But I decided not to throw it all away.,
141,4.0,15.0,Carrie,You know what? Actually. Just these.,
142,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Later, while Aidan worked on the apartment next door, I worked on reprogramming my attitude. Could I be a spring bride? Happy bride? Peek-a-boo bride?",
143,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Stop! Stop, Aidan, stop it! Aidan! I'm freaking out. I can't, l. I cannot. I am having a very strong reaction to all this change.",
144,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"- Okay, just don't freak out. ",
145,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- I am freaking out! It all just feels really fast.,
146,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- The hole? I told you I was gonna come through there… ,
147,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- It’s not just the hole! ,
148,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- What?,
149,4.0,15.0,Carrie,It’s the marriage stuff. I love you and I'm sorry if I'm not supposed to talk to you about this. But I have to.,
150,4.0,15.0,Aidan,Come here. Just sit down on the floor. What's happening?,
151,4.0,15.0,Carrie,I didn't want to say anything but then that thing came through my wall. I don't think that I'm ready to get married yet. Do you hate me?,
152,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"- No, come on. You're catching me a little off guard here. ",
153,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"- I know, I just…",
154,4.0,15.0,Aidan,I hear you. I need a minute here. Is it because I said we could get ''Maui'd''?,
155,4.0,15.0,Carrie,Thank you for making a joke.,
156,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"Let's slow it down. Okay, how much time do you need? Six months? Nine months? The end of the year?",
157,4.0,15.0,Carrie,Which year?,
158,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"- So, you just need some time? ",
159,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Yeah. I think so.,
160,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- Okay. We'll get there. ,
161,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"- Thank you, Aidan. Thank you for listening.",
162,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- Did you see the washer and dryer? ,
163,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- I love you.,
164,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"The next day, Miranda enjoyed a few moments of solitude with her bills and her cleaning lady.",
165,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"Magda? I'm going to pay you for a whole month, okay?",
166,4.0,15.0,Magda,Look what I found on the kitchen counter. It’s beautiful! Did they tell you boy or girl?,
167,4.0,15.0,Miranda,"Yes, it's a boy.",
168,4.0,15.0,Magda,"A boy! A boy! A boy is coming into the house. A boy is highest blessing, It’s good luck. Smile. Smile for a boy.",
169,4.0,15.0,Miranda,- A boy! ,
170,4.0,15.0,Magda,- A boy!,
171,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"And while Miranda had tea for one, Charlotte was mastering Tea for Two.",
172,4.0,15.0,Pat,"We're coming across the floor with me. Step shuffle step for you, step shuffle step for me. And now, two by two. Go! Next pair. Nice! Very nice.",
173,4.0,15.0,Pat,"- You, in the flowers go! ",
174,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,- I don't have a partner.,
175,4.0,15.0,Pat,- Just go it alone. And go! ,
176,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,- I don't want to go it alone.,
177,4.0,15.0,Pat,"You'll be fine. Come on, flowers. Picture me upon your knee.",
178,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,"I can't do this, I'm sorry, I can't. And I shouldn't have to. I deserve a real partner. And this song is abusive and hurtful.",
179,4.0,15.0,Viola,Should I stop?,
180,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,You should think about how a person would feel who's going through a very difficult divorce and who just comes here to have fun and feel good about themselves!,
181,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"In her attempt to skip over her grief, Charlotte tapped into her pain.",
182,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"The next week, we all put on our finest and gathered at the Black and White Ball, Richard's charity fundraiser.",
183,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,- Aidan looks so handsome in a tux. ,
184,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Yeah.,
185,4.0,15.0,Miranda,How's he doing?,
186,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Good, good. Still a little thrown about the change in plans, but good. I just hope I did the right thing.",
187,4.0,15.0,Miranda,You followed your feelings. That's always the right thing to do. I'm drinking seltzer and I'm in a formal gown with an elastowaist. I really fit in here.,
188,4.0,15.0,Carrie,Do you realize you're growing a teeny tiny penis inside you? That's so sci-fi.,
189,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,My God! You're having a boy? Aren't you so excited?,
190,4.0,15.0,Aidan,Two glasses of French fizz here and a sody for you.,
191,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,- Did you know that Miranda's having a boy? ,
192,4.0,15.0,Miranda,- I think I'm going to hurt myself.,
193,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"I trust you're finding something noteworthy to put in your column, J.J.?",
194,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,Look at you. I can think of other places I'd like to put my column tonight.,
195,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"Dream on, J.J.",
196,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,"Never hurts to ask, right? I'm sure you know this one, but guess which hotel king is having very private relations with a very public New York woman?",
197,4.0,15.0,Samantha,I guess the cat's out of the bag.,
198,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,"It’s out of the bag. Look at them together. That Judith McBain, she's insatiable. Word is they've done it in every one of his hotels.",
199,4.0,15.0,Samantha,- Excuse me.,
200,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,"- Good chatting with you, Jonesy.",
201,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Samantha could handle the press, but she couldn’t the truth.",
202,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"The fucking Richard is fucking the entire styles section and for the first time in my life, I actually give a shit. I think I have monogamy. I must've caught it from you people.",
203,4.0,15.0,Carrie,It’s airborne.,
204,4.0,15.0,Samantha,There are a lot of hot guys but I don't want to fuck a single one of them. Not him or him.,
205,4.0,15.0,Aidan,What about this guy over here? He asked me if I knew you.,
206,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"Who? No, I'm not interested. Damn it, I'm not well.",
207,4.0,15.0,Charlotte,- At least you're not getting divorced. ,
208,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Just tell Richard how you feel.,
209,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"I can't do that. He likes me because I'm supposed to be immune to this bullshit. There goes that Judith Bitchy-Mc-Bitch heading for Richard. Okay, I'm going to go over there and I'm going to be completely calm, and completely professional.",
210,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Every day, millions of people suffer from monogamy. There is no known cure.",
211,4.0,15.0,Samantha,I'm so sorry.,
212,4.0,15.0,Richard,"Hey, gorgeous. Great turnout.",
213,4.0,15.0,Samantha,This is purely professional. Exactly how many women are you fucking?,
214,4.0,15.0,Richard,"It’s the ''Black and White'' Ball, not the ''black and blue'' Ball.",
215,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"As your publicist, I must tell you all this canoodling and bed hopping is tacky and immature. It makes investors nervous, and frankly…",
216,4.0,15.0,Richard,"It makes you nervous, too.",
217,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"As your publicist, yes, it does. So, grow up. Stop fucking other women. Just fuck me.",
218,4.0,15.0,Richard,"- Come on, we're not the monotonous, I mean, monogamous type. ",
219,4.0,15.0,Samantha,- Maybe I am.,
220,4.0,15.0,Richard,"- Gorgeous, I'm not. ",
221,4.0,15.0,Samantha,- Fine.,
222,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,"Jonesy, you get any good dish for me?",
223,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"In fact, she did. Samantha gave J.J. an exclusive just to prove to herself that she was not.",
224,4.0,15.0,Samantha,- What the… ,
225,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,- Shit. Shit! Just a minute.,
226,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"It wasn't the first time a guy went soft on Samantha, but it was the first time she didn't care.",
227,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,"Jonesy, I can't believe this is happening. This never happens to me. I can give a list of women who this has never happened with.",
228,4.0,15.0,Samantha,That wouldn’t be necessary.,
229,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,"No, I want to, I want you to call Anna Bonnie at 9577297 or Lisa Yelling at 459...",
230,4.0,15.0,Richard,"There you are. Listen, maybe I was too quick back there. If there's anyone who could keep monotony interesting…",
231,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,Man of the hour.,
232,4.0,15.0,Richard,You'll never change. And I wouldn't want you to. Let's just keep things as they were.,
233,4.0,15.0,Samantha,This doesn't count. He couldn't even stay hard.,
234,4.0,15.0,Richard,"- Good seeing you, J.J. ",
235,4.0,15.0,Samantha,"- Don't say it, limp dick. ",
236,4.0,15.0,J.J. Mitchell,- Okay.,
237,4.0,15.0,Carrie,That's a very good look for you.,
238,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"I think we both look kinda sharp tonight. You've never looked prettier, my friend.",
239,4.0,15.0,Carrie,Thank you.,
240,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"Let's get married tonight. Come on, you've got this beautiful white dress on, I've got this tux for another 13 hours. Let's just do it. Let's get in a cab, airport, Vegas. No muss, no fuss.",
241,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Aidan, this isn't funny.",
242,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"Come on! Look, if we get married tonight, we wake up tomorrow, it's done. All right? We're still us.",
243,4.0,15.0,Aidan,We don't even have to tell anybody.,
244,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- What about what we discussed? ,
245,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- Come on. You're just scared.,
246,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Yes, I'm scared. Come on, Aidan, we talked about this.",
247,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"No, you talked and I listened. Carrie, I looked at you tonight from across the room and I thought, I love her. And she loves me. And what are we waiting for?",
248,4.0,15.0,Carrie,Because I need more time.,
249,4.0,15.0,Aidan,What's going to change? This is me. I don't have any tricks up my sleeve. This is who I am.,
250,4.0,15.0,Carrie,This isn't about you. I'm not ready for marriage.,
251,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"I am. I'm sorry if that scares you, but I am. People fall in love, they get married. That's what they do.",
252,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Not necessarily. Why can't we just keep things the way they are, just live together?",
253,4.0,15.0,Aidan,I don't want to live together. I've had girlfriends for 20 years. I want you to be my wife.,
254,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"Aidan, you're pushing me.",
255,4.0,15.0,Aidan,Maybe you need to be pushed. What's the big deal? It’s just a stupid piece of paper.,
256,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"If it's just a stupid piece of paper, then why do we need it?",
257,4.0,15.0,Aidan,Because I need it! I want to make this official and lock this thing down. I want the whole wide world to know that you're mine.,
258,4.0,15.0,Carrie,Who else's would I be? Oh My God. You still don't trust me.,
259,4.0,15.0,Aidan,You don't even wear that ring on your finger.,
260,4.0,15.0,Carrie,I am yours. There is nobody else. I love you. But I can't marry you to make you trust me. Look at me. Look at me before we make a huge mistake.,
261,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"- If you don't want to marry me right now, you'll never want to marry me. ",
262,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- That's not true.,
263,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- I think it is. I'm gonna sleep in the other apartment tonight. ,
264,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Really?,
265,4.0,15.0,Aidan,"- Yeah, really. ",
266,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Just for tonight?,
267,4.0,15.0,Aidan,- I can't believe I'm back here again. ,
268,4.0,15.0,Carrie,- Shit.,
269,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"We had left the land of black and white, and now, everything was gray.",
270,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"To the outside world, Miranda's maternal gene might never kick in. But that night she felt a real kick from deep inside.",
271,4.0,15.0,Carrie,"There are some walls you can push through and some you can't. That was the only night we would ever spend on the other side of the wall. The next day, Aidan moved out.",
0,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"A girl in pigtails once said, ''There's no place like home. '' But then her home didn't have a toilet that flushed for no reason...and a boyfriend who was moving out for one big reason.",
1,4.0,16.0,Aidan,- That's the last of it.,
2,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Okay.,
3,4.0,16.0,Aidan,- You want me to fix that?,
4,4.0,16.0,Carrie," - No, it's okay. I can get someone to come and fix it.",
5,4.0,16.0,Aidan,Just let me get in there for a second. Hold the Ball Cock. This thing right here. Right there. That should do it. I should go.,
6,4.0,16.0,Carrie,You can't leave. Our last words to each other can't be ''Ball Cock.'' You should definitely stay...at least for another day. Or forever.,
7,4.0,16.0,Aidan,We've been through this. I can't.,
8,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Are you sure? ,
9,4.0,16.0,Aidan,- I am.,
10,4.0,16.0,Carrie,Aidan... this is difficult to say. I left the ring on the clown table.,
11,4.0,16.0,Aidan,- - That's yours.,
12,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"No, I should never have accepted it in the first place. I'm sorry. Please take the ring.",
13,4.0,16.0,Aidan,I want you to have it.,
14,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Please take it. If you do or say... one more nice thing... ,
15,4.0,16.0,Aidan,- I got to go.,
16,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"I can't watch you leave, so I think I am gonna... I'm better... I'm gonna stand here. Could you just... could you just shut the door?",
17,4.0,16.0,Aidan,Carrie.,
18,4.0,16.0,Carrie," I know. Go. Three hours later, I peeled myself off the bathroom floor. Apparently, there were things that were difficult for Aidan to say, as well. I curled up to read Aidan's last words to me, also known as the goodbye letter.",
19,4.0,16.0,Samantha,Aidan's evicting her?,
20,4.0,16.0,Miranda,He's not evicting her. He's giving her 30 days to decide what she wants to do.,
21,4.0,16.0,Samantha,That's just tacky.,
22,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"Look, life gets complicated. Steve and I are drawing up papers to time-share our kid.",
23,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Great love stories are supposed to end with tragedy and tears, not papers from the law firm of Gold and Vogel.",
24,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"This is more than fair. He's asking you to buy your apartment for the exact price he paid, or you can vacate and he'll sell it.",
25,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Vacate? I'm homeless. I'll be a bag lady, a Fendi bag lady, but a bag lady.",
26,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,You should think of buying your place.,
27,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- I am not a buyer. New York is a town of renters. Everybody rents. ,
28,4.0,16.0,Samantha,I don't.,
29,4.0,16.0,Miranda, I don't.,
30,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- I don't.,
31,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- You got yours in the settlement. You did not have to pay for it. ,
32,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- I paid for that apartment.,
33,4.0,16.0,Miranda,I'm pregnant. I can't control it.,
34,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"Honey, you better learn, because that is unappetizing.",
35,4.0,16.0,Miranda,I know. I am so swollen and gassy. I am like a flotation device.,
36,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"I'll get this one, and I don't want a fight out of you. Save it for your down payment.",
37,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Excuse me! You bought the Chanel wallet?,
38,4.0,16.0,Samantha," - No, Richard gave it to me as a gift.",
39,4.0,16.0,Miranda,- Nice. What was the occasion?,
40,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- No occasion.,
41,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- He is in love with you. ,
42,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- He is not in love with me.,
43,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- You don't know that. ,
44,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- I do. Take a look at the card.,
45,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"- ''Style for style. Best, Richard.'' ",
46,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- ''Best.'' Yikes.,
47,4.0,16.0,Miranda,- ''Best'' is the worst. ,
48,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Even Gold and Vogel give you ''sincerely.'',
49,4.0,16.0,Samantha,'Best'' is like signing ''Not love.'',
50,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,It’s the thought that counts. He bought you something he knew you'd love.,
51,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- He's a pretty generous guy with money.,
52,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Aidan wanted me to keep the ring.,
53,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,"- You did, didn't you? ",
54,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"- Honey, you're a fool.",
55,4.0,16.0,Carrie,No. It was the right thing to do. Do you ever think about giving yours back?,
56,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,"- No, I love that ring. ",
57,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"- I couldn't keep it. Every time I looked at it, it would break my heart.",
58,4.0,16.0,Ruby Rosen,- This ring is worth a lot.,
59,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,"- Tiffany. 2.17 carats, platinum setting.",
60,4.0,16.0,Ruby Rosen,"Beautiful cut, very few inclusions. So, what do you want to do with it?",
61,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,I was thinking maybe I'd turn it into a necklace.,
62,4.0,16.0,Ruby Rosen,- A floating diamond necklace would be to die. Very now. ,
63,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,"- So, a lot of people do this.",
64,4.0,16.0,Ruby Rosen,"These were my baguettes. Because it turned out by husband was a faggot, now they're earrings. But he had good taste. So, a necklace?",
65,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,I'm not sure.,
66,4.0,16.0,Ruby Rosen,Maybe a pendant. We can melt down the platinum setting and turn it into spectacular earrings.,
67,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,Melt it down?,
68,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"There, in the wedding band boneyard, Charlotte started to melt down.",
69,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- I don't think I'm ready for this. ,
70,4.0,16.0,Ruby Rosen,- Just don't take it to the gypsies next door.,
71,4.0,16.0,Linda,Okay. Let's look at your assets here at the bank. You may be able to use them as collateral for the loan.,
72,4.0,16.0,Intercom,"Linda, Line 1.",
73,4.0,16.0,Linda,It says here that you have $700 in your checking account.,
74,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- I just paid my credit card bill. ,
75,4.0,16.0,Linda,- And $957 in savings.,
76,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Look, Linda. You're single, right? I'm sure you can appreciate my problem. I just broke up with my fiancé which, trust me, is traumatic enough.",
77,4.0,16.0,Intercom,"Linda, Line 2.",
78,4.0,16.0,Carrie,And now I have 25 days to either find the money to buy my place or I am out on the street.,
79,4.0,16.0,Linda,"Do you have any other income, besides the column?",
80,4.0,16.0,Carrie,No. But I was chosen as New York magazine's best pick for city columnist. I was the pick over Pete Hamill.,
81,4.0,16.0,Linda,"- What about your assets outside the bank? Property, stocks, bonds? ",
82,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- No. No. No.,
83,4.0,16.0,Linda,"I'm sorry, Ms. Bradshaw, but you are not a desirable candidate for a loan.",
84,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"After assessing what little assets I had, I realized I would have to change my lifestyle.",
85,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"- Excuse me, could you tell me how much the bus is?",
86,4.0,16.0,Bus Waiter, - $1.50.,
87,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Really? Wow. Last time I took the bus, it was like 75 cents. You know, for $3 more, you could take a cab. For crying out loud.",
88,4.0,16.0,Bus Waiter,- Why do you have to take the bus if you're on the bus? ,
89,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"- My thoughts exactly. So here I was, a 35 year old single woman with no financial security but many life experiences behind me. Did that mean nothing? After All, heartbreak and breakups are the hardest kind of work. So shouldn't there be some sort of credit for enduring them? And if not, how do you retain a sense of value when you have nothing concrete to show for it? Because at the end of yet another failed relationship, when all you have are war wounds and self doubt, you have to wonder, what's it all worth?",
90,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,"Let me just say again, I love your gallery, so if there are ever any openings, you have my resume.",
91,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, a woman with far fewer financial worries was also contemplating her worth. Charlotte knew the ring didn't mean as much, now that she wasn't with Trey. But on that particularity low Thursday, she put on her 2.17carat diamond and wandered around her 2.17carat Park Avenue apartment.",
92,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"That night, at Richard's...",
93,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- Another gift. Are you trying to spoil me?,
94,4.0,16.0,Richard,- That's the plan.,
95,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"- La Petite Coquette, my favorite. ",
96,4.0,16.0,Richard,- I know. I pay attention. Wait a minute. There's a card.,
97,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"Oh, the card. ''Sexy for sexy. Best, Richard.''",
98,4.0,16.0,Richard,"- Why don't you slip into that, while I pour us some Crystal? ",
99,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- I'll do my very best.,
100,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink. This is torture. Why are you doing this to me? I can't buy shoes.",
101,4.0,16.0,Miranda,I have to buy shoes. None of my old ones fit. Even my feet are fat.,
102,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- These are pretty. ,
103,4.0,16.0,Miranda,- I'm looking for comfortable.,
104,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Then I'll try these for you. Excuse me, sir, could I try these please, in a 7.5? And these. I guess, just all of these. But, sir, no matter what happens in the next 20 minutes, under no circumstances am I to buy these. I'm just trying them on for fun.",
105,4.0,16.0,Salesman,How fun for me.,
106,4.0,16.0,Miranda,- Could I try these in a nine? ,
107,4.0,16.0,Salesman,- Sure.,
108,4.0,16.0,Miranda,- Thanks.,
109,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- What is that smell? -,
110,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"Sorry. I've learned to control the sound now, but not the activity.",
111,4.0,16.0,Carrie,That's just mean. Damn! How'll people know to scatter without a warning?,
112,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"Although, maybe it's not that I control the noise as much as my ass is so big the sound is now muffled. Look at my fingers. They're like sausages. I can't even get my ring off. I'm telling you, the fat ass, the farting, it's ridiculous. I am unfuckable and I have never been so horny in my entire life.",
113,4.0,16.0,Carrie,Really?,
114,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"Yeah. That's why you should be married while pregnant, so somebody is obligated to have sex with you. I'm an undesirable.",
115,4.0,16.0,Carrie,No. I am. The lady at the bank said I was an unattractive candidate for a loan. Where did all my money go? I know I've made some.,
116,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"- At $400 a pop, how many of these do you have? Fifty? ",
117,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Come on.,
118,4.0,16.0,Miranda,- A hundred?,
119,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Would that be wrong?,
120,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"- 100 times 400, there's your down payment. ",
121,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"- That's only $4,000. -",
122,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"No, it's $40,000.",
123,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"I spent $40,000 on shoes and I have no place to live? I will literally be the old woman who lived in her shoes.",
124,4.0,16.0,Miranda,I pulled my own finger. I'm a walking whoopie cushion.,
125,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"When a girl gets backed up against a wall she can't afford, she has to consider renting others.",
126,4.0,16.0,Carrie,That's the closet? Where do the shoes go?,
127,4.0,16.0,Delia the Broker,You get one of those racks that hang on the door.,
128,4.0,16.0,Carrie,I'll hang myself on a door if I have to live here. Do I smell curry?,
129,4.0,16.0,Delia the Broker,There's an Indian restaurant downstairs.,
130,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Delia, I ask you, how can this apartment be $2,800 a month? I pay $750 for something that's twice the size. It don't smell like takeout.",
131,4.0,16.0,Delia the Broker,You have a rent-controlled apartment. I suggest you stay there.,
132,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, that's really not an option. What other shit holes are you showing me today?",
133,4.0,16.0,Delia the Broker,"I have to be honest. With your attitude and price limitations, I think you should consider Weehawken.",
134,4.0,16.0,Big,"Get back to me when the numbers are in. Look at you, all dressed up. Applying for a job here?",
135,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"So this is where you work. It’s cute. It’s smaller than I expected. I always imagined rows and rows of blondes in tight sweaters, typing.",
136,4.0,16.0,Big,They're at lunch.,
137,4.0,16.0,Carrie,I am here in an official capacity. Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?,
138,4.0,16.0,Big,By all means. Pick a chair.,
139,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Faced with the prospect of Weehawken, I decided it was time to call in the big guns.",
140,4.0,16.0,Big,"Now, what can I do for you?",
141,4.0,16.0,Carrie,I once read that you took something like $3 million and leveraged it to build a $100 million building. How did you do that?,
142,4.0,16.0,Big,What's going on?,
143,4.0,16.0,Carrie,I want to buy my apartment but I have no money. I'm worth nothing.,
144,4.0,16.0,Big,"You're worth a million bucks, Bradshaw.",
145,4.0,16.0,Carrie,Maybe you should go work at a bank. Aidan and I broke up.,
146,4.0,16.0,Big,So it's not just money troubles. Why didn't you call me?,
147,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- I got enough troubles.,
148,4.0,16.0,Big,- What happened?,
149,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Apparently, you were right, I am not the marrying kind.",
150,4.0,16.0,Big,"Or the timing wasn't right. You're going to be ok, kid.",
151,4.0,16.0,Carrie,So I need money. You know money. I need to know what you know about money.,
152,4.0,16.0,Big,Simple. I'll tell you how to get the money.,
153,4.0,16.0,Carrie,Big offered me the money for my down payment. But I could never take it. Could I?,
154,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"- No, you couldn't. ",
155,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,"- He just gave you $30,000?",
156,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- As a loan. I would pay him back. ,
157,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- Take the money.,
158,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"When a man gives you money, you give him control.",
159,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"It’s just money. Man, woman, who cares? It’s fluid. Someone needs it, you give it. You need it, you take it.",
160,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,I'm uncomfortable with this conversation. We shouldn't be talking about money.,
161,4.0,16.0,Miranda,Why not? We talk about everything else.,
162,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"People are funny about money. Like Richard, he's happy to buy me gifts, but…",
163,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Still no ''love''? ,
164,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"- No, but he continues to send his best.",
165,4.0,16.0,Miranda,Don't cash Big's check. I'll loan you the money.,
166,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"You're about to have a baby. I can't take your money. And furthermore, do you have that much?",
167,4.0,16.0,Miranda,I have about half that.,
168,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- What? Does no one else shoe shop? ,
169,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- I could loan you the rest.,
170,4.0,16.0,Carrie,Look...that is really...sweet of you two to offer. It’s really sweet. But I'm gonna do this on my own.,
171,4.0,16.0,Carrie,So I can't tape it back.,
172,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,I have news. Looks like I have gotten a job as a docent at the Museum of Modern Art.,
173,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- What does that pay? I can docent. ,
174,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,"- It’s a volunteer job, but they're very coveted positions.",
175,4.0,16.0,Carrie, - I have no fortune. I didn't need a cookie to tell me that.,
176,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- These fans only cost $1. I'm going to save a lot of money on air conditioning. ,
177,4.0,16.0,Miranda,- You okay?,
178,4.0,16.0,Carrie,No apartment and no Aidan. It’s been a rough two weeks. Just give me a block. I'm going to be fine.,
179,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"As I thought about leaving the apartment that I had lived in for the past decade, I realized how much I would miss it. Through everything, it had always been there for me. And suddenly, I was irrationality angry, and I knew just where and who to take it irrationality out on.",
180,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- Hi. What are you doing here? ,
181,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- I was just in the neighborhood.,
182,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- Come on in. You want some iced tea or something? ,
183,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Why didn't you offer me the money?,
184,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- I knew you were going to say that.,
185,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- I wouldn't take it.,
186,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,Then what does it matter if I offer it or not?,
187,4.0,16.0,Carrie,Because I would have offered it to you. You're my friend.,
188,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,Money and friendship don't mix. My father and his friend Paul were never the same…,
189,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"We're not talking about your father and his friend Paul. We're talking about you and your friend, me. And for the record, I am aware that I have some financial messiness hat I have to clean up, and to that end, I am looking into some freelance magazine work. I have been offered $4 a word at Vogue. That is a lot. Most people get $2. So, yes, I have made some mistakes, and, Charlotte, you have made some mistakes. When you were making those mistakes, I was sitting across from you at the coffee shop, nodding and listening and supporting you. I was not sitting at a Chinese restaurant, turning away when you should have been looking at me. And what kills me is, you don't even have to work. You're volunteering.",
190,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,I love you. But it's not my job to fix your finances. You're a 35 year old woman. You need to learn to stand on your own.,
191,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- What is that on your finger? ,
192,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- I just wear it when I'm alone in my house.,
193,4.0,16.0,Carrie,And you're telling me to be more independent?,
194,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,"It’s my ring. I can wear it if I want to. And so what if it makes me feel better? And for the record, the only reason I'm volunteering is, no one will hire me. I've called seven galleries. Apparently, I have too much experience.",
195,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"You're right. It’s your ring, it’s your business. I got all worked up on the walk over here.",
196,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,You walked?,
197,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"No, I took a $5 cab ride, seven blocks. These shoes pinch my feet, but I love them. I am in a financial cul-de-sac. But I'm going to take the bus. I just hope I'm not on it.",
198,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, in the lap of luxury…",
199,4.0,16.0,Roger,"- It’s okay. I'm Richard's assistant, and I'm gay. ",
200,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- Okay. Turn around and give a girl a moment.,
201,4.0,16.0,Roger,"I'm Roger, and you weren't supposed to be here.",
202,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"Richard left, and I decided to take a nice relaxing bath, but now that's shot to shit. Okay. Decent.",
203,4.0,16.0,Roger,"I am so sorry, but if it's any consolation, wow!",
204,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"Pilates. So, why haven't I seen you around the office?",
205,4.0,16.0,Roger,He has three assistants. I run his errands.,
206,4.0,16.0,Samantha,His errands! Is that an errand gift wrapped on the bed?,
207,4.0,16.0,Roger,All right. I'm his personal shopper. He's a very busy man.,
208,4.0,16.0,Samantha,I'll bet. Exactly how many women are you buying gifts for?,
209,4.0,16.0,Roger,- What do you mean? ,
210,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- You've seen my bush. We're a little past acting coy.,
211,4.0,16.0,Roger,"Since you came into the picture, a lot less. And he's never sent me to Chanel before. That was fun. Great wallet. It also came in red, but I couldn't decide…",
212,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"So, Richard didn't pick out any of these gifts?",
213,4.0,16.0,Roger,"Technically, no. But he really likes you. I can tell.",
214,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"Yeah, he thinks I'm the best. Wait, the cards. ''Style for style''? ''Sexy for sexy''?",
215,4.0,16.0,Roger,"- ''Me for you.'' Please, don't have me fired. ",
216,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- I'll tell you what. I'll pretend you don't exist.,
217,4.0,16.0,Roger,- Thank you. -,
218,4.0,16.0,Samantha," If you do one thing for me.- Oh, Richard. ",
219,4.0,16.0,Richard,- I thought you'd like it.,
220,4.0,16.0,Samantha,"You did? I forgot the card. ''Gorgeous for gorgeous. Love, Richard.''",
221,4.0,16.0,Richard,"- I love you, Samantha. I do. ",
222,4.0,16.0,Samantha,- You do? And I love... this.,
223,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Samantha could have said, ''I love you. '' But she was afraid it would cost her too much. So she did what she did best.",
224,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"So every other Saturday and Wednesday at 5:00 p.m, you take him.",
225,4.0,16.0,Steve,- I was thinking 4:57 p.m. would be better.,
226,4.0,16.0,Miranda, - You think this is stupid.,
227,4.0,16.0,Steve,"No, I just was thinking that things are gonna to get off schedule. I mean, we're talking about a kid, not a train. I'd offer to do that for you, but I don't think it's in the contract.",
228,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"Don't give me a hard time. I could fart you into oblivion right now. That feels so great. Thanks. Steve, am I ugly?",
229,4.0,16.0,Steve,- What? No. You got that glow.,
230,4.0,16.0,Miranda,- But would you want to have sex with me?,
231,4.0,16.0,Steve,What are you talking about? You're pregnant.,
232,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"Yeah, and another charming side effect, aside from flatulence and bloating, is all I can think about is sex. And who would want to have sex with me?",
233,4.0,16.0,Steve,"I'd like to have sex with you, but I'm pretty sure it's not allowed. I've read section B14 in the contract and it said nothing about sex.",
234,4.0,16.0,Miranda,- Fuck the contract and please fuck me. ,
235,4.0,16.0,Steve,Ouch.,
236,4.0,16.0,Miranda,What? ,
237,4.0,16.0,Steve,- You're squishing me.,
238,4.0,16.0,Miranda,- I'm sorry. ,
239,4.0,16.0,Steve,- No.,
240,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"That night, Steve gave Miranda multiple orgasms for what it's worth.",
241,4.0,16.0,Miranda,"Just to be clear, this doesn't mean we're a couple. This is a mercy fuck.",
242,4.0,16.0,Carrie,I'm sorry about the other day. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.,
243,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,You were right. I didn't want to let go of being Mrs. Trey MacDougal.,
244,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- I think you are coping amazingly well. I'm just scared. ,
245,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,"- I know. Me, too.",
246,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Wow! We're alone again. ,
247,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- Yeah. I want you to take the ring for your down payment.,
248,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"- No, I can't. You love this ring. ",
249,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,"- No, I love what the ring represented.",
250,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"No, you're right. It would make things too complicated.",
251,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,This is a straightforward business proposal. Clean and simple. Why do I have all this money if I can't help out a friend?,
252,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- But it would be a loan. I'll pay you back. ,
253,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- I know.,
254,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- I want you to think really carefully about this. ,
255,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- I have.,
256,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- Will you be comfortable knowing that it will take me time to pay you back? ,
257,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- I will.,
258,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"I really appreciate this. I'll pay you back. You know that, right?",
259,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,- I do. It’s ok. I trust you. Will you take the ring? ,
260,4.0,16.0,Carrie,- I will. Thank you.,
261,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Charlotte had taken her painful past and turned it into my hopeful future, and that made the ring priceless.",
262,4.0,16.0,Charlotte,I start work at the museum next week.,
263,4.0,16.0,Carrie,That's great. Guess what. I got Vogue up to $4.50 a word.,
264,4.0,16.0,Repairman,"I fixed the toilet, and should be done with this by the end of the afternoon.",
265,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"Okay, great. Thank you.",
266,4.0,16.0,Carrie,"It wasn't quite as easy as clicking my Manolo Blahniks three times, but it was worth it. I was home.",
0,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Every morning, millions of New Yorkers leave their crowded apartments and head out to the even more crowded streets, on their way to work. Today, I was one of them. Sometimes, a girl just needs a new start. I had a new do, a new mortgage, and, therefore, a new job. I had just submitted my first freelance article for one of the most relevant and provocative magazines on the newsstands today, at least to me. Vogue. Also known as Mecca, where I belonged.",
1,4.0,17.0,Enid,- This isn't Vogue. ,
2,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- You didn't like it?,
3,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,- No one is saying that. ,
4,4.0,17.0,Enid,"- I am. I didn't like it. There, I said it.",
5,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"- What Enid is trying to say, Carrie, is that you wrote a wonderful first draft. ",
6,4.0,17.0,Enid,- That isn't Vogue.,
7,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"There it was, the article I'd put my heart and soul into and it was bleeding.",
8,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,Your spin on the idea is very clever. Different types of men as the new accessories for fall. A Prada... ''A Prada dress should always be worn with an investment banker.'' That's wonderful.,
9,4.0,17.0,Enid,"Julian, the assignment was 500 words on accessories, not men. And I'm not convinced she knows anything about purses. Or, for that matter, men.",
10,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"Enid, for the love of God…",
11,4.0,17.0,Enid,"Ms. Bradshaw, what you've handed us here is essentially your newspaper column with the word ''style'' jammed in where the word ''sex'' used to be. We're not looking for Vogue according to your agenda. No one cares about your agenda.",
12,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,That's not true.,
13,4.0,17.0,Enid,"Forgive me. I don't care about your agenda. I care about designers. Oscar de la Renta, Chanel, Dior. I want less Carrie Bradshaw and more... ''Carry this bag with these shoes.'' Do you see what I mean? You're a writer. You should be writing this down.",
14,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"I was trying to find a way to introduce the bags and the bracelets with a little humor. Kind of, ''Men are the new black.'' It was supposed to be funny.",
15,4.0,17.0,Enid,- It was supposed to be bags. ,
16,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- I didn't really bring a writing implement. Okay. Bags.,
17,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"An hour later, Enid had to leave for a lunch date, presumably to devour another writer.",
18,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"Don't let Enid get to you. She just came back from Paris and apparently humor and irony are out this season. Billie Holiday, the only woman I can think of in more pain than you right now. Come on, cookie, chin up, in publishing you need two things, a tough hide and a dry martini.",
19,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Martinis in the morning, is this allowed? Is it Vogue?",
20,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,Only in absolute emergencies. Last time I broke this out was when I heard that fun fur was making a comeback.,
21,4.0,17.0,Carrie,Look at this mess. Why was I even hired?,
22,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,I'm afraid you've got me to blame for that. My daughter introduced me to your column about a year ago. I thought you'd be a natural at Vogue.,
23,4.0,17.0,Carrie,I guess you thought wrong.,
24,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"Haven't been wrong yet. Vogue is all about vision. And you cookie have got vision. We just have to find a way to hide your vision from Enid's vision. A little less you, a little more purse. Come on. - Drink. ",
25,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Cheers! One and a half martinis later...,
26,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"- And the sad thing is, this is what I do best. I mean, look at it. ",
27,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"- Cookie, you're drunk.",
28,4.0,17.0,Carrie,Yeah. Cookie's drunk. I'm drunk at Vogue.,
29,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,How can anyone get so drunk on one and a half martinis?,
30,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"I didn't eat breakfast and I'm a size two, which should make me perfect for Vogue, but nope, I'm drunk and a failure at Vogue.",
31,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,I feel awful. This is my fault.,
32,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Julian, I came in here today so cocky. I thought I knew it All. I had my men jokes and my purse puns. You heard her. What do I know about purses? Nothing. What do I know about men? Oops! I spilled. I spilled at Vogue.",
33,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,- Okay. Maybe we better just take you home. ,
34,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- I can't go out there. I'm drunk. I'm drunk at Vogue.,
35,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"Left, right. Now look at me. Pretend I'm saying something fantastic about corsets.",
36,4.0,17.0,Woman,- Excuse me.,
37,4.0,17.0,Carrie, - Please tell me that wasn't Anna Win tour.,
38,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"- It wasn't. Now just... Left, right. ",
39,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"- Right. So sorry. That night, at a more appropriate Cocktail hour,..",
40,4.0,17.0,Samantha,"Come on, there must be something you want for your birthday.",
41,4.0,17.0,Richard,What I want for my birthday is not to celebrate it this year.,
42,4.0,17.0,Samantha,What if I want to celebrate it?,
43,4.0,17.0,Richard,That would be celebration enough. Besides I have everything I need.,
44,4.0,17.0,Samantha,"It’s not about needing something. It’s about wanting something just for fun. Something decadent, something naughty.",
45,4.0,17.0,Alexa,"May I tempt you with dessert? How was everything this evening, Mr. Wright.?",
46,4.0,17.0,Richard,"Delicious, Thank you.",
47,4.0,17.0,Alexa,"Alexa. I took the liberty of preordering our Chocolate soufflé for you and Ms. Jones, if you want something sweet.",
48,4.0,17.0,Richard,Always. Thank you for keeping an eye on us.,
49,4.0,17.0,Alexa,I couldn't help it. You're the most attractive couple in the restaurant.,
50,4.0,17.0,Richard,I know what I'd like for my birthday. An all-night nonstop championship fuck fest with you...,
51,4.0,17.0,Samantha,Then consider your candles blown.,
52,4.0,17.0,Richard,...and Alexa. You asked.,
53,4.0,17.0,Samantha,Is a three-way with a 21 year old a bad idea for Richard's birthday?,
54,4.0,17.0,Carrie,What are you gonna get him next year? A four way?,
55,4.0,17.0,Samantha,- He doesn’t wanna be monogamous. He'll cheat with or without me.,
56,4.0,17.0,Carrie, - Happy birthday to you.,
57,4.0,17.0,Samantha,- He didn't ask me to get him a hooker. ,
58,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- These are the options?,
59,4.0,17.0,Samantha,"It’s someone we know and at least this way, I'm part of the fantasy.",
60,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,The fantasy being that he's attracted to someone young enough to be his daughter.,
61,4.0,17.0,Samantha,"He is, Charlotte, that's the problem! Richard's in his fucking prime. Men look better as they get older and women get…",
62,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Three ways, apparently, or a Marc Jacobs ultramod little notebook. Evidently, I'm recommending it to Vogue shoppers.",
63,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"Just be careful. Samantha. When a man has a fantasy and you fulfill it, there always is the chance that the relationship could blow up. Then you're the idiot who did it with him on the golf course, or something.",
64,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Was it you and Trey? ,
65,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"- No, it's a ''for instance.''",
66,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"Sorry I'm late. I was shopping for a stroller. I shouldn't even be here. I should be out doing all the things I'm supposed to before the baby comes, and I'm unable to leave my apartment ever again.",
67,4.0,17.0,Carrie,Like what? Jujitsu and off-track betting?,
68,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"Like buying a crib. Evidently, I'm to go to Crib World, because it's a whole world of cribs. I guess Crib City wasn't big enough. Why isn't there a store called ''This is The Crib For You''? And they just have one great crib. They deliver it and assemble it, and help raise the child.",
69,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,You don't have a crib yet?,
70,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"No, I have a job instead. I'm sorry, but when am I supposed to find time to prepare for this baby?",
71,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- I don't have a vague idea how I'm going to do any of it. ,
72,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"- I don't have a Vogue idea, so hello.",
73,4.0,17.0,Samantha,Why don't you let One Ball help you?,
74,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"Yeah. I tried that. He starts acting all father figure, and I get territorial, and the salespeople get confused. Trust me, it's too complicated for Crib World.",
75,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"Let me help you. You said you didn't want a baby shower, but you can change your mind.",
76,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- I hate baby showers. ,
77,4.0,17.0,Samantha,- Who doesn't?,
78,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"The games, the finger sandwiches, all that enforced oohing and ahing.",
79,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"I don't ooh and aah, and I don't care who's having a baby.",
80,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,Think of the gifts. It’d be a great way to get all the stuff you need.,
81,4.0,17.0,Carrie,Without going to Crib World.,
82,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- Who would I invite besides you guys? ,
83,4.0,17.0,Samantha,- All the bitches that made you go to theirs.,
84,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,It’s your shower. You can invite or not invite whoever you choose.,
85,4.0,17.0,Miranda,Would you really want to throw me a baby shower after all you've been through this year?,
86,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"Yeah, I think it would be good for me.",
87,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"Okay, but no cutesy, storky shit. Just an adult, dignified lunch with presents which I will open after everyone leaves.",
88,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,You have to open the presents.,
89,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"No opening of presents, no games, no crust less bread. And I want fried chicken.",
90,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- Fried chicken! But it's not Super Bowl Sunday. ,
91,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"- It’s my shower, and I'll fry if I want to.",
92,4.0,17.0,Samantha,- What should we do for our gift? ,
93,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Let's just stick to the registry three-way.,
94,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"The next day, Charlotte decided if she was going to host a baby shower, she should hide the evidence that she had wanted one of her own.",
95,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Later that week, I had a meal with the perfect dinner accessory, Julian.",
96,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"My wife is a former dancer. She was with the Martha Graham Company. And the first time I saw her on stage, I fell in love with her. She plied and I plotzed. It’ll be 24 years next September.",
97,4.0,17.0,Carrie,So you got married right out of grade school.,
98,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,I knew there was something about you that I liked. What about your life? Is there a man in your life? Is it a great love?,
99,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"I just broke up with somebody. And yes, it was a great love. But he went there. I went there.",
100,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,And there you have it.,
101,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"- So, Julian the reason that I asked you to dinner tonight…",
102,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,- Was because you knew I would pay?,
103,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Besides that. I wanted to tell you that I really appreciate your interest in my article, but I've decided not to finish it.",
104,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"So what are you gonna do, you're just going to quit? No, I don't let my kids quit.",
105,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Technically, I'm not one of your kids. I'm just a girl you get drunk sometimes.",
106,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"All right, forget about me. What would your father say about you quitting?",
107,4.0,17.0,Carrie,My father wouldn't have a whole lot to say about quitting. He quit my mother and me when I was little.,
108,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,- Sorry. ,
109,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Thanks. I mean a long time ago. I was 5.,
110,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,- Why did he leave? ,
111,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"- No idea, never said. And that's the name of that tune. What?",
112,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"No, it's interesting. Your father leaves without any answers and you spend your life asking questions about men. It’s 20 years of analysis. Forgive me?",
113,4.0,17.0,Carrie,Yes.,
114,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"Okay, Vogue. What if I could fix it so that you only deal with me, and Enid spends less time hating your writing and more time hating Tom Ford's line?",
115,4.0,17.0,Carrie,Julian.,
116,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"Come on, cookie, you're no quitter. And we get to work on this together. What do you say?",
117,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Why are you being so sweet? ,
118,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,- Martini guilt.,
119,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Later that night, I got to thinking about fathers, or the lack of them. Some say a daughter's relationship with her father is the model for all her subsequent relationships with men. Is that just pop psychology, or is there some truth to it? And if you were given a less-than-perfect model, does it mean a life of less-than-perfect relationships? I couldn’t help but wonder, how much does a father figure figure?",
120,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"Gentlemen, I understand your concern, but I'm looking at the contract right now. I'm sorry, could you hold for a moment? I'm on a conference call here.",
121,4.0,17.0,Woman on Phone,- Charlotte York says it's an emergency. ,
122,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"- Charlotte. What's wrong, you okay?",
123,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,I'm fine. I'm just looking at your registry. There are some things you forgot to include. Like a Manhattan Whoozit.,
124,4.0,17.0,Miranda,A what?,
125,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,It’s a learning toy. Active toys make for passive children. There's a philosophy on it.,
126,4.0,17.0,Miranda,I don't have the time for philosophy. I'm on a conference call with our London office.,
127,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- What about a Peek Ball? ,
128,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"- Jesus, I have to get back.",
129,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"One more quick thing. I know you said no storks, but I saw the most gorgeous centerpiece in the shape of a stork",
130,4.0,17.0,Miranda,I'm at work.,
131,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- We have to order it by noon. Its feathers are white Fiji mum. ,
132,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- What did I say?,
133,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"No storks. But these people are giving expensive gifts, and they’ll want to see a little baby.",
134,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"No storks, no present opening, no cutesy baby stuff. We agreed.",
135,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- What about a marzipan baby carriage?,
136,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- Charlotte!,
137,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"It has a white chocolate peanut butter baby inside, and you can eat the baby. Miranda? Miranda?",
138,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"The next day, Samantha made a conference call of her own.",
139,4.0,17.0,Alexa,"Ms. Jones, welcome. Will Mr. Wright be joining you for lunch?",
140,4.0,17.0,Samantha,"No, Actually, it's Richard's birthday this weekend and I'm trying to put together a little celebration for him.",
141,4.0,17.0,Alexa,Certainly. Would you like to reserve one of our banquet rooms or…,
142,4.0,17.0,Samantha,"That won't be necessary. It’s a very small party. A very small private party of three. Just Richard, myself, and a third, if you have any openings.",
143,4.0,17.0,Alexa,- I'm wide open. ,
144,4.0,17.0,Samantha,- Lucky me.,
145,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"And now that Charlotte's house was ready for the baby shower, she wanted to make sure Miranda's house was ready for the baby.",
146,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"The bassinet can go over here by the bed. So that when you get up for feedings, he's right there. See? Unless you're planning to have him sleep in bed with you.",
147,4.0,17.0,Miranda,Can't I go to jail for that?,
148,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"No. In fact many cultures believe it's safer for the baby's breathing. Although you do run the risk of rolling over and smashing him while asleep. But that almost never happens. But almost it never, so if you want to err on the side of safety…",
149,4.0,17.0,Miranda,I'll just put him in the thing.,
150,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"The bassinet? Great. And then when he's big enough, you can put the crib here. Is that what you were thinking?",
151,4.0,17.0,Miranda,I hadn't thought about that yet.,
152,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"You need to start thinking about these things, ‘cause there are a million questions to answer before the baby ever gets here. Do you have a birthing plan? Do you know what kind of mother you want to be?",
153,4.0,17.0,Miranda,Yes. I plan to be a good mother.,
154,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"But a marsupial mom or a stroller mom? Will you be breastfeeding or bottle-feeding? And what about baby proofing? 'Cause with all the sharp edges around here, I mean, this place is a deathtrap!",
155,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"- Okay, you need to back off. ",
156,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- I'm just trying to help.,
157,4.0,17.0,Miranda,This is your idea of helping? Pointing out all the things I do badly?,
158,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- I'm not pointing out… ,
159,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"- Yes, you are.",
160,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"You need to try to let other people in a little, because once you have that baby, it's not just you anymore. You're not gonna be able to control everything.",
161,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"Look, I just want to enjoy the fried chicken and be done with it.",
162,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,I had to rethink the fried chicken because you’re the only one who wanted all that breading. So instead we're having mesclun greens and a lovely puttanesca with a Fiji mum center-piece.,
163,4.0,17.0,Miranda,A Fiji mum stork centerpiece?,
164,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,One stork. I think you can deal with one.,
165,4.0,17.0,Miranda,Two storks. I saw the invitation! There’s a stork on the invitation.,
166,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,That's not a stork! That is a duck. That duck is smoking an ''it's a boy'' cigar. That's not enough for children.,
167,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- That duck is fucked! This whole shower is fucked! ,
168,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- You can't have a shower without baby stuff!,
169,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"- You keep this stuff, and you'll have a shower without a mommy! ",
170,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- Fine!,
171,4.0,17.0,Miranda,Fine!,
172,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"Miranda, you better show up. I am not getting stuck with a bunch of lawyers, who, if they're anything like you, won't even appreciate a beautiful puttanesca!",
173,4.0,17.0,Miranda,Watch out for the sharp edges!,
174,4.0,17.0,Miranda,Thanks for coming down and talking.,
175,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"I really didn't have a choice. You couldn't make it up the stairs. There, you feel better?",
176,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"- The back, yes. The other stuff, no. I'm gonna be a terrible mother. ",
177,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Miranda.,
178,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"I am! I have no maternal instincts, no patience. The way I yelled at Charlotte. She was just trying to point out what needed to be child-proofed. Oh, my God.",
179,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- What? ,
180,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- I'm what needs to be child-proofed.,
181,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"You wanna quit? Come on, I'll quit the magazine. You quit the baby. We'll be two quitters. We'll live happily ever after.",
182,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- Can I tell you a secret? ,
183,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- You're not really pregnant? It’s water weight?,
184,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"I dropped my niece on her head. I was babysitting when I was 13, and I got bored. I got bored Carrie. I was doing my homework, she slid down the couch. Two stitches.",
185,4.0,17.0,Carrie,Get off my stoop!,
186,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"How is this kid ever gonna make it? A type A mother, who works 50 hours a week, and no father figure.",
187,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- He has a father figure. ,
188,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- Steve.,
189,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- I meant you. ,
190,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- Really?,
191,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Yeah. ,
192,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- I do like those Yankees!,
193,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"- Second date, dinner and a movie. ",
194,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"- Yeah, I hate them.",
195,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Hey Do you think it really can be as simple as, ''My father walked out, therefore I'll always be messed up about men?''",
196,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"My father came home every night at 7:00 on the dot, and I have no clue about men either.",
197,4.0,17.0,Carrie,So it's a crapshoot.,
198,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- Do I have to go to my own baby shower? -,
199,4.0,17.0,Carrie,I R.S.V.P.'d to a duck with a cigar.,
200,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- All right. ,
201,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- You're going.,
202,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- It’s late. I've got to catch a cab. ,
203,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"- Wait, let me get you a forklift. When you're ready.",
204,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- Okay. ,
205,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Go.,
206,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- Thank you. ,
207,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- You did good.,
208,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"- You, too.",
209,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"The next day, Miranda decided not to duck her own shower.",
210,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,Hey You showed up.,
211,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"Bring on the ladies in hats, and let's get this over with. Where'd you put all the storks?",
212,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- You said you didn't want any storks. ,
213,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"- I know, but... What did you do?",
214,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"It’s your shower. Can you get that? ‘Cause I have to get the sandwiches, which have all of their crusts. Nothing cute. No ridiculous, over-the-top baby stuff allowed.",
215,4.0,17.0,Samantha,"Hey, Momma!",
216,4.0,17.0,Carrie,Why are you opening the door? Shouldn't you to be sitting on a lily pad being worshipped?,
217,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- What is that? ,
218,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- It’s a four tiered baby cake made entirely of diapers.,
219,4.0,17.0,Samantha,- I baked it myself.,
220,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- We ordered it online,
221,4.0,17.0,Miranda,. - What am I supposed to do with it?,
222,4.0,17.0,Samantha,- How the hell should we know? Didn't you want one? ,
223,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- No.,
224,4.0,17.0,Carrie,We're not taking it back. We've already been seen carrying it down Park Avenue. Definitely not Vogue.,
225,4.0,17.0,Miranda,Charlotte said it was the shower gift.,
226,4.0,17.0,Carrie,I told you we should've gotten the massage certificate.,
227,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"One hour, two platters of chicken, and 13 lawyers later, all talk had turned to babies. Almost all.",
228,4.0,17.0,Samantha,"She may be 21, but I have 21 years of experience. I could fuck her under the table.",
229,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"That’s good to know. Because in a three-way situation, it could come to that.",
230,4.0,17.0,Samantha,- I have tricks she hasn't even seen. ,
231,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Those Trix aren't for kids.,
232,4.0,17.0,Samantha,"- And no matter whatever happens, she's just renting him. I own. ",
233,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Exactly.,
234,4.0,17.0,Samantha,"- Although, I don't really own.",
235,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- So it's more of an illegal sublet type thing?,
236,4.0,17.0,Samantha,- Yeah. ,
237,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- Wow!,
238,4.0,17.0,Gretchen,"It’s a breast pump. I didn't want you coming to my office to borrow mine. You know what? I have to pee. Wait. Here. You take Charles. Have fun, Mom.",

245,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- That is elegant.,
246,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"- Oh, my God. That's exactly like the rattle Trey gave me when we first...",
247,4.0,17.0,Miranda, - You okay?,
248,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"- I'm fine. Sorry, everybody. Excuse me. ",
249,4.0,17.0,Wendy,- What did I do?,
250,4.0,17.0,Miranda,- Charlotte? ,
251,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,- I just need to be alone right now.,

253,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,I'm sorry I ruined your shower.,
254,4.0,17.0,Miranda,"You didn't. And there wouldn't even be a shower to ruin if it weren't for you. Look, I know this is hard. And I really appreciate you trying to be okay with me having this baby, because I need you. I mean, let's face it. You're the only person in my life who knows how important it is to have a cake made entirely out of diapers.",
255,4.0,17.0,Charlotte,"There's lotion in there, too.",

279,4.0,17.0,Richard,"- No, this is great. Just you and me.",
280,4.0,17.0,Samantha,What about my three-way? I have a busboy arriving at midnight.,
281,4.0,17.0,Richard,"- Seriously, let's try this. Just you and me, nobody else. ",
282,4.0,17.0,Samantha,Oh. Okay.,
283,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"By giving Richard what he thought he wanted, Samantha finally got what she needed, monogamy.",
284,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"The Following night, with a little after-hours help from my favorite editor, I finished the impossible, my first Vogue piece.",
285,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"And now, my favorite part of the writing process...print.",
286,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"Congratulations, cookie. Five hundred beautifully written words, and some of them even include the Carrie Bradshaw agenda. Cleverly hidden, of course.",
287,4.0,17.0,Carrie,It’s a literary Where's Waldo?,
288,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"When I finish a piece, I usually celebrate by opening a bottle of Chateau La Tour. How do you celebrate?",
289,4.0,17.0,Carrie,By buying shoes and purses.,

291,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Oh, my God! It’s too good! I'm sorry, but it's... it's too good!",
292,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,You're just like a kid in a couture candy store.,
293,4.0,17.0,Carrie,- This is too much! How can this be? ,
294,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"- Designers send these things, and we photograph them.",
295,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"- Oh, my God! ",
296,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,Shh Carrie.,
297,4.0,17.0,Carrie,Do you know what these are?,
298,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,- We're not even supposed to be in here.,
299,4.0,17.0,Carrie,Manolo Blahnik Mary Janes. I thought these were an urban shoe myth.,
300,4.0,17.0,Julian Fisher,"Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be pillaging the men's side.",
301,4.0,17.0,Carrie,"Okay. Oh, my God! These are authentic patent leather. And if they don't fit, so help me, I'm gonna wear them anyway. Crap. They almost fit.",

322,4.0,17.0,Enid,"This new piece shows improvement, but still positively reeks of you. This magazine doesn't care what Carrie Bradshaw says about shoes. What does Carrie Bradshaw know about shoes?",

324,4.0,17.0,Enid,- I'm walking.,
325,4.0,17.0,Carrie," - I'm walking, too. I admit it's tempting to wish for the perfect boss or the perfect parent, or the perfect outfit. But maybe the best any of us can do is not quit. Play the hand we've been given, and accessorize the outfit we've got.",
0,4.0,18.0,Carrie,"There is a time of year in New York when, even before the first leaf falls you can feel the seasons click.",

44,4.0,18.0,Big,I'm not big on good-byes. I would have called you.,
45,4.0,18.0,Carrie,From where? A wine vat somewhere? You can't leave New York.,
46,4.0,18.0,Carrie,You're the Chrysler Building.,

48,4.0,18.0,Big,"Arrivederci, baby.",
49,4.0,18.0,Carrie,But why? ,
50,4.0,18.0,Big,I'm tired of old New York.,
51,4.0,18.0,Carrie,"If you're tired, you take a nap-a.",
52,4.0,18.0,Carrie,You don't move to Napa.,
53,4.0,18.0,Carrie,I need a cocktail.,

175,4.0,18.0,Carrie,"That it's all pre-destined, written in the stars.",

177,4.0,18.0,Carrie,"And even if our every man, every kiss, every heartache is pre-ordered from some cosmic catalog can we still take a wrong step and wander off our own personal Milky Way? I couldn't help but wonder can you make a mistake and miss your fate?",
178,4.0,18.0,Charlotte,"If you look at how brilliantly Monet suggested glimpses of sky and the luscious, tactile quality of the canvas you can see how he established his fate as one of the true poets of nature and my personal favorite.",

200,5.0,4.0,Stanford,Judgey wudgey was a bear ,
201,5.0,4.0,Carrie,"I think it's pretty much agreed that it goes open-minded: good, judgmental: bad. But are we being too quick to judge judgment? Perhaps judgment is not so much a snap decision as an early warning and detection device.",
202,5.0,4.0,Carrie,"If it is instantly clear that a person, place or profession is not for you, is it better to ignore your better judgment and read between the lines or should you judge a book by its cover? You've got mail.",

216,5.0,4.0,Miranda,Although they did have this itty-bitty thing of tuna that I loved.,

252,5.0,4.0,Carrie,I saw that coming.,
253,5.0,4.0,Samantha,I could get out with nothing more than a fine lip gloss.,
254,5.0,4.0,Carrie,- You're awfully quiet.,
255,5.0,4.0,Charlotte,- What is there to say? The man has bad manners.,

30,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,Justin was just in time because Charlotte was finally ready for a new relationship.,
31,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,"- Good afternoon, Mrs. Collier. ",
32,5.0,5.0,Mrs. Collier,"- Yes, it certainly was.",
33,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,- And she's one of the friendly ones. ,
34,5.0,5.0,Justin,- I think I'd better get back to work.,
35,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"I was in a new relationship, too, with my publisher.",
36,5.0,5.0,Courtney,"Okay, bye-bye. I am so freaking excited about this party! Seriously, Carrie, we are so golden. People actually want to come to this book party. All of Cond Nast is coming, including GQ, which is actual straight men. Someone better kiss me at this thing.",
37,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"So, it's not about selling books. It's about finding you a boyfriend.",
38,5.0,5.0,Jack,Courtney... I didn't know you had somebody in here. I'm sorry.,
39,5.0,5.0,Courtney,- What are you doing here? ,
40,5.0,5.0,Jack,- Using the Xerox machine.,
41,5.0,5.0,Courtney,You finished your second book?,x
42,5.0,5.0,Jack,"- No, my suicide note. Would you like a Save the Date card?  ",
43,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Please.,
44,5.0,5.0,Courtney,- You know each other? ,
45,5.0,5.0,Jack,- No.,
46,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- No.,
47,5.0,5.0,Courtney,Carrie Bradshaw. Her book of essays comes out this week.,
48,5.0,5.0,Jack,Very exciting.,
49,5.0,5.0,Courtney,Jack Berger. We published his first book last year.,
50,5.0,5.0,Carrie,And your name is Berger?,
51,5.0,5.0,Jack,Never heard of me. What does that say about your publicity department?,
52,5.0,5.0,Courtney,- Not your priMary market.  ,
53,5.0,5.0,Jack,- Because she's not in my immediate family.,
54,5.0,5.0,Courtney,Jack wrote a hilarious comic novel that speaks to men the same way your column speaks to women.,
55,5.0,5.0,Jack,Except men don't buy hilarious comic novels. That's the flaw in the plan.,
56,5.0,5.0,Carrie,What's your book?,
57,5.0,5.0,Jack,Half-off. That's what it's called now. It's just half-off. Sometimes it's 75 cents on a card table on Sixth Avenue.,
58,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Next to the incense.  ,
59,5.0,5.0,Jack,- Exactly.,
60,5.0,5.0,Courtney,"You two should talk, because he knows the whole deal: The party, the signings, the reading, the tour.",
61,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Minutes later, Jack Berger and I slowed down for a little fast food.",
62,5.0,5.0,Jack,- I'm not so much feeding them as I'm hitting them. ,
63,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Yes, I see that.",
64,5.0,5.0,Jack,"""'Did the man have a little repressed anger? ""'Or did he just dislike pigeons? ' The woman wondered.""",
65,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"The woman is tripping over the term ""repressed.""",
66,5.0,5.0,Jack,I'm not really bitter. I'm just trying it on for size.,
67,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- I think it fits.,
68,5.0,5.0,Jack,- It's a little tight in the crotch.,
69,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- You're saying ""crotch"" to me? We just met. ",
70,5.0,5.0,Jack,- Long in the sleeve?,
71,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Not as funny. ,
72,5.0,5.0,Jack,"- See that? It had to be ""crotch."" How's that strawberry shake?",
73,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"It's very tasty, thank you.",
74,5.0,5.0,Jack,I can't believe that you ordered strawberry. Who orders strawberry after the age of 11?,
75,5.0,5.0,Carrie,You have so much to learn about women.,
76,5.0,5.0,Jack,"That's what a few reviewers said. All right, what's next? How long do I have you for?",
77,5.0,5.0,Carrie,I don't know. What else is on your agenda?,
78,5.0,5.0,Jack,I gotta pick up some dry cleaning. Would it be weird for you to come with me to pick it up?,
79,5.0,5.0,Carrie,No. It would be weird for you to send me.,
80,5.0,5.0,Jack,It's a nice place. It's right around the corner. Family joint. They have an actual abacus.,
81,5.0,5.0,Carrie,We were having one of those great first dates you can only have when it's not an actual date.,
82,5.0,5.0,Carrie,Thank you.,
83,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- What's that? ,
84,5.0,5.0,Jack,- It's stupid. I collect found playing cards. They're all over the city.,
85,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Really? I never noticed.,
86,5.0,5.0,Jack,"Well, you will now. That's how it works. I'm hoping to get a full deck. Insert the obvious joke here. And I didn't have a two of hearts. It's a good day.",
87,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Yes, it is. Berger. ",
88,5.0,5.0,Jack,- We're on a last-name basis now? Okay.,
89,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Would you, by any chance, want to be my plus one on Thursday? It's my book party, and I don't have a date... and you'll have the clean shirt and all.",
90,5.0,5.0,Jack,"I would love that, but my girlfriend's parents are coming to visit, and they are staying with us.",
91,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"It was like a bomb that just kept exploding: ""I have a girlfriend. We live together. This whole flirtation's in your head.""",
92,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,He should have mentioned her earlier.,
93,5.0,5.0,Samantha,"But not too early. I hate it when men do that. ""I have a girlfriend."" Calm down. I just asked if that seat was taken.",
94,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,That guy's a jerk.,
95,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Thing is, I don't think he is. I sparked with this person. I never spark. I wonder how happy they are. This is not a good side of me. Seriously, what's the point of meeting someone like that if they're not available?",
96,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,It's the universe telling you they're still out there.,
97,5.0,5.0,Miranda,Maybe the universe is telling you all the good ones are taken.,
98,5.0,5.0,Samantha,"I'm telling you, all the good ones are coming to the party.",
99,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,What did he look like?,
100,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"I can't remember, which is what happens when I really like someone. I just remember a feeling. Or he was a dating mirage. I was so hungry for a spark, I hallucinated a man.",
101,5.0,5.0,Samantha,"Stop. You're the toast of the town. Finish your salad, and I'll treat you to a little mani-pedi-botox.",
102,5.0,5.0,Miranda,You say that like everybody does it.,
103,5.0,5.0,Samantha,- Everybody will. ,
104,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- I think I'd rather just crawl into bed.,
105,5.0,5.0,Samantha,"Honey, a little perspective! You have a fun, exciting, intellectually stimulating career, and there's about to be a huge soire thrown in your honor.",
106,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- And I'll be without a plus one. ,
107,5.0,5.0,Samantha,- I'll be your plus one.,
108,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"He should have said ""we"" something. ""We go to this dry cleaners."" ""We might be breaking up soon.""",
109,5.0,5.0,Miranda,- I didn't tell Walker I had a baby.  ,
110,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,- How could you not mention it?,
111,5.0,5.0,Miranda,"It didn't come up. If he'd asked me directly, ""Have you given birth recently?"" I would have said, ""First of all, define 'recently.""'",
112,5.0,5.0,Carrie,You have to tell him.,
113,5.0,5.0,Miranda,"I know. I will. I just don't want it to change everything. If I didn't have a baby, this is a guy I'd be dating.",
114,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,"If Carrie's guy didn't have a girlfriend, then he's a guy she'd be dating, but he does.",
115,5.0,5.0,Carrie,Thanks for bringing that up again.,
116,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"In New York, they say you're always looking for a job, a boyfriend, or an apartment. So, let's say you have two out of three, and they're fabulous. Why do we let the one thing we don't have affect how we feel about all the things we do have? Why does one minus a plus one feel like it adds up to zero?",
117,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Samantha didn't need a man to make her feel positive, but she did need a man to inject her forehead every so often.",
118,5.0,5.0,Aide,"We like to warn our patients that some people find it difficult to register emotion on their faces after the injections. So you might have to say: ""I am so angry.""",
119,5.0,5.0,Doctor,- Miss Jones is familiar with the procedure. ,
120,5.0,5.0,Samantha,- New ones?,
121,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Like most high-powered women, Samantha could handle the stress of her job, but not the stress lines.",
122,5.0,5.0,Doctor,"Before we do the botox, have you thought about a freshening chemical peel? It takes 15 minutes, and it can make you look 10 to 20 years younger.",
123,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"15 minutes later, Samantha seemed to have it all...peeled off.",
124,5.0,5.0,Carrie,There are times when a woman relishes being alone.,
125,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Oh, my God!",
126,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"And those are the times you usually run into someone you don't wanna see. In my case, it was Enid, my editor at Vogue, also alone.",
127,5.0,5.0,Enid,- Carrie. ,
128,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Enid. Hi. How are you?,
129,5.0,5.0,Enid,- Good. ,
130,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Are you meeting someone?,
131,5.0,5.0,Enid,"- No, I'm just grabbing a quick bite. ",
132,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Would you like to...,
133,5.0,5.0,Enid,"- Oh, no. Not if you're working. ",
134,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- It's fine. I was just reading.,
135,5.0,5.0,Enid,- Hello!  ,
136,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Hi.,
137,5.0,5.0,Enid,- Hello! is what you're...  ,
138,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Oh, reading!",
139,5.0,5.0,Enid,"- So, do you really want company? ",
140,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Sure. I just ordered.,
141,5.0,5.0,Enid,- I guess this way I can expense it. ,
142,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Right.,
143,5.0,5.0,Carrie,Enid and I ran out of Vogue stuff to talk about midway through our salads.,
144,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Do you live in the neighborhood? ,
145,5.0,5.0,Enid,- No. But the man I'm seeing does.,
146,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- So, there's a man. ",
147,5.0,5.0,Enid,"- Yes, there is a man.",
148,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"That's great. You have a wildly successful career and a relationship. I was worried we women, only get one or the other, but you have it all. You gotta give me something here. I'm working my ass off.",
149,5.0,5.0,Enid,"All right. To speak in magazine copy, yes, I have it all on the East Side. He has someone else on the West Side. Luckily, the park provides a buffer.",
150,5.0,5.0,Carrie,You're okay with that?,
151,5.0,5.0,Enid,"Yes. I don't have time for a full-time man. I have a full-time job. That's the key to having it all. Stop expecting it to look like what you thought it would look like. That's true of the fall lines, and it's true of relationships.",
152,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Her little tip earned Enid one invitation to my party. That night, Charlotte let her perfect plus one have it all.",
153,5.0,5.0,Carrie,She even let him stay the night in her perfect pre-war apartment.,
154,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,"- Oh, yes, I ordered breakfast.",
155,5.0,5.0,Justin,- You're too good to be true.,
156,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, Charlotte was about to get much more than she ordered.",
157,5.0,5.0,Bunny,- Is anybody home? ,
158,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,- Yes. I am.,
159,5.0,5.0,Bunny,"- Hello, Charlotte.  ",
160,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,"- Bunny, what are you doing here?",
161,5.0,5.0,Bunny,"The question is, what are you doing here? I'm hearing things from the co-op board.",
162,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,They're spying on me?,
163,5.0,5.0,Bunny,Mrs. Collier saw you kissing a male caller in the hall in the middle of the day.,
164,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,I believe that kissing is allowed.,
165,5.0,5.0,Bunny,"And Mrs. Pierce said a gentleman. We assume it was the same one, but who knows came home with you last night. And according to the doorman, he hasn't left yet.",
166,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,- What I do with my life in my apartment... ,
167,5.0,5.0,Bunny,"- That's the thing, dear. It's not your apartment.",
168,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,Trey gave me this apartment.,
169,5.0,5.0,Bunny,"It's not Trey's to give. And this apartment remains in the MacDougal name whereas you, Charlotte York, do not. So, you see, it's rather a sticky subject made stickier by the fact that you're still married.",
170,5.0,5.0,Justin,- You're married?  ,
171,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,- I'm not married. I'm separated.,
172,5.0,5.0,Bunny,Aren't you missing a pair of trousers?,
173,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,- You have to go. ,
174,5.0,5.0,Bunny,"- Don't you hustle me out, young lady. This is Chanel.",
175,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Charlotte discovered that a plus one, plus one ex-mother-in-law equals disaster.",
176,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, I was manning Party Central.",
177,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,Anthony is going to be my date to the party.,
178,5.0,5.0,Carrie,What happened to this perfect plus one we all had to meet?,
179,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,- I don't wanna talk about it. ,
180,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Sweetie, what... That's my call waiting. Hang on a sec.",
181,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,"No, I can't. That's the locksmith. Bunny's back.",
182,5.0,5.0,Stanford,"- I'm definitely on the list, correct?  ",
183,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Of course you're on the list.,
184,5.0,5.0,Stanford,"- Good, 'cause I'm bringing my boyfriend. ",
185,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Yes, I heard.",
186,5.0,5.0,Stanford,"I don't want to seem like a nobody, now that I have a somebody.",
187,5.0,5.0,Carrie,It's okay to be a nobody when you have nobody?,
188,5.0,5.0,Stanford,"Apparently, you're nobody till somebody loves you.",
189,5.0,5.0,Carrie,I can't believe I used to like that song. It's the co-dependent national anthem.,
190,5.0,5.0,Stanford,Methinks someone's a little jealy.,
191,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"I just miss having you as my plus one. The gay guy is the single gal's safety net. Even Charlotte has a gay plus one, and this is my big night.",
192,5.0,5.0,Stanford,- Her little boy bitch Anthony is coming? ,
193,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Yes, he's coming. He styled the event.",
194,5.0,5.0,Stanford,"Good. I'm glad he'll be there. 'Cause he's bringing a woman, and I have it all.",
195,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- I have a call. See you tonight. ,
196,5.0,5.0,Stanford,"- Okay, ciao.",
197,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Hello? ,
198,5.0,5.0,Samantha,"- Honey, I've had a little something done and it's not as bad as yesterday, but I've looked better. I'm not sure I should go to the party.",
199,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"You have to come. You're my publicist. Thanks to you, there's going to be 8,000 people there. I would like to see at least one familiar face. I need you. I can't talk to the press. I can't keep everyone straight. And you said you'd be my plus one.",
200,5.0,5.0,Samantha,- All right. Don't worry about a thing. I'll be there.  ,
201,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Okay. Thank you.,
202,5.0,5.0,Carrie,The party was one of those amazing events that would definitely end up on page 6. The fact that it was my party was just icing on the beautiful little cakes that were being passed around by beautiful little waiters.,
203,5.0,5.0,Photographer,"Congratulations! Carrie, one more! Carrie, right here!",
204,5.0,5.0,Courtney,"Oh, my God, Carrie! Can you believe this?",
205,5.0,5.0,Carrie,Is it a bad thing if the party is better than the book?,
206,5.0,5.0,Courtney,"I've been turning people away. Not the straight men, of course.",
207,5.0,5.0,Carrie,Have you seen Samantha? Vanity Fair doesn't have a table.,
208,5.0,5.0,Courtney,Not your problem. Enjoy. Cute guy.,
209,5.0,5.0,Harold Keenan,"Hello, Carrie. I'm Harold Keenan of The New Yorker. I've been following your career. Let me just say congratulations.",
210,5.0,5.0,Samantha,"Carrie, I'm here! You look amazing.",
211,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Harold Keenan from The New Yorker. This is Samantha Jones, bee-keeper. What are you doing under there? Talk to the man. Let him see your face.",
212,5.0,5.0,Carrie,There she was. My plus one. Minus one layer of skin.,
213,5.0,5.0,Samantha,"Hi, I've had a chemical peel. I'm Carrie's publicist.",
214,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Could you at least separate the two thoughts, chemical peel, Carrie's publicist? Why did you do this?",
215,5.0,5.0,Samantha,It was an impulse purchase.,
216,5.0,5.0,Carrie,Gum is an impulse purchase. This is more than gum.,
217,5.0,5.0,Samantha,I wanted to be super-fresh for the party.,
218,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Well, you are. You look like Beef Carpaccio. Veil down, I think.",
219,5.0,5.0,Samantha,No. If you knew how many dinner parties I've sat through across from one of these.,
220,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- And you were able to eat?  ,
221,5.0,5.0,Samantha,- I'm entitled to a chemical peel.,
222,5.0,5.0,Carrie,Wait! No! The hat was good!,
223,5.0,5.0,Samantha,"Women shouldn't have to hide in the shadows because they've had cosmetic surgery, which society nearly demands of them.",
224,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Make that political statement elsewhere. This is my party, and you're scaring people.",
225,5.0,5.0,Samantha,- I've had a chemical peel. ,
226,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- And she's not afraid to say it.,
227,5.0,5.0,Marcus,"When I had my nose job, I stayed in for a month.",
228,5.0,5.0,Stanford,Excuse us. We have to go find Charlotte and her tiny little friend.,
229,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,We were just getting to know each other. I was planning on telling him.,
230,5.0,5.0,Anthony,"You can wrap it up in a Tiffany bow, but the point is you wanted to get laid first.",
231,5.0,5.0,Stanford,"- Charlotte, hello. ",
232,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,"- Hi, Stanford. You remember Anthony.",
233,5.0,5.0,Stanford,"You tried to fix us up at the fashion show. I didn't know he'd be here. This is Marcus, my boyfriend.",
234,5.0,5.0,Anthony,- Really? How long you two been going together? ,
235,5.0,5.0,Stanford,- Four months.,
236,5.0,5.0,Anthony,- Four whole months. Good luck to you. ,
237,5.0,5.0,Stanford,- We don't need luck. We're in love.  ,
238,5.0,5.0,Anthony,- Shrimp!,
239,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"For some people, having it all is not enough. They need someone who missed out on it all to be jealous.",
240,5.0,5.0,Stanford,We're getting a house in the Hamptons.,
241,5.0,5.0,Anthony,Friggin' coconut shrimp! What do you do with the tails? Mr. Shrimpy!,
242,5.0,5.0,Stanford,And he has a large penis!,
243,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,Where in the Hamptons?,
244,5.0,5.0,Carrie,From a pair of queens to a hand still not shown...,
245,5.0,5.0,Walker,- Maybe you and I should go somewhere a little less crowded. Like...  ,
246,5.0,5.0,Miranda,- Anywhere in Manhattan?,
247,5.0,5.0,Walker,- Your apartment? ,
248,5.0,5.0,Miranda,"- Yes, but first I have to tell you something.",
249,5.0,5.0,Walker,- There's someone else. ,
250,5.0,5.0,Miranda,- Sort of. I had a baby. But I'm still allowed to have sex.,
251,5.0,5.0,Walker,- Is it... mine? ,
252,5.0,5.0,Miranda,- The guy's a friend who I accidentally slept with.,
253,5.0,5.0,Walker,I'm not good with kids.,
254,5.0,5.0,Miranda,"Neither am I. Months from now, if we're still together, we'll figure this out.",
255,5.0,5.0,Miranda,"But for now, it's just us and I'm still the same person. Let's go screw our brains out.",
256,5.0,5.0,Miranda,That feels amazing!,
257,5.0,5.0,Walker,- You sure we won't wake him? ,
258,5.0,5.0,Miranda,- He's fine.,
259,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Miranda was trying to prove she could still do it all: Bring home the bacon, bring home the baby, and bring home an orgasm.",
260,5.0,5.0,Miranda,Don't stop. Mommy's coming!,
261,5.0,5.0,Walker,- I don't think I can do this. I told you. I'm not a baby guy. ,
262,5.0,5.0,Miranda,- Couldn't I just please come first?,
263,5.0,5.0,Miranda,"Oh, so now you stop crying. So, here we are.",
264,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"The night of my big party, Miranda finally gave in to her little party, because she wasn't the same person. She was plus one.",
265,5.0,5.0,Issac,"So, a book! Does anybody read books anymore? Actually, I think books are coming back. You can quote me on the side of a bus if you want: ""Books are back."" Isaac Mizrahi.",
266,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Okay, I'll remember that. ",
267,5.0,5.0,Issac,- Meet me.,
268,5.0,5.0,Enid,"- Perfect party, Carrie. Congratulations. ",
269,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Worth coming downtown for?,
270,5.0,5.0,Carrie,Was that a yes or a no? Last one. Thank you.,
271,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"As I looked around, I thought, ""Who needs a date?"" I can have my cake and eat it, too. Then suddenly, there he was, looking cuter than I remembered and minus one girlfriend.",
272,5.0,5.0,Jack,"Hey, lady of the hour. You're hard to get to.",
273,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"So's the dessert tray, when it's your party.",
274,5.0,5.0,Jack,"Just as a point of reference, my book party could have fit in the coat check of your party.",
275,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- 400 of my closest acquaintances.  ,
276,5.0,5.0,Jack,- You look great.,
277,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- I thought you couldn't make it. ,
278,5.0,5.0,Jack,"- I had to come by, say congratulations.",
279,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Thanks for coming, Berger. ",

281,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- You, too.",
282,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,- Was that the spark guy?  ,
283,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Yes, it was. Jack Berger. All by his lonesome.",
284,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,- He is awfully cute. ,
285,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Is he? I forgot again.,
286,5.0,5.0,Samantha,"He's obviously here because he felt something, too.",
287,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"Can you call me from a cab and tell me that? I love you, but your face...",
288,5.0,5.0,Samantha,I know. The caterer just shooed me away from the buffet. Do you mind if I go home?,
289,5.0,5.0,Carrie,I thought you'd never ask! Thank you for being here.,
290,5.0,5.0,Samantha,"Honey, I wouldn't have gone out in public like this for anyone but you.",
291,5.0,5.0,Carrie,I know. And I have to live with that.,
292,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,"I might go, too. My plus one dumped me for a shrimp waiter.",
293,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"I'd love to leave, but I have to stay. I'm like the ice sculpture the party's supposed to happen around. I had to let him go, correct? I just wish he'd told me right up front.",
294,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,"The thing is, there's some things people don't admit because they just don't like the way it sounds. Like, ""I'm getting divorced.""",
295,5.0,5.0,Carrie,I'm lonely. I am. The loneliness is palpable.,
296,5.0,5.0,Enid,- Don't tell me you invited Cliff.  ,
297,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Cliff who?,
298,5.0,5.0,Enid,My Cliff. He's with her.,
299,5.0,5.0,Carrie,That's him? Cliff from Primetime Stories? Don't make a scene! Is this her side of town?,
300,5.0,5.0,Enid,"We're below Houston! East Side, West Side, who the hell knows down here? I am so angry.",
301,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"As it turns out, even the most together-woman can't keep it together when it comes to love...",
302,5.0,5.0,Charlotte,- Who was that? ,
303,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- My role model.,
304,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"…Because just below the surface, we're all raw and exposed.",
305,5.0,5.0,Driver,"- So, what was the party for? ",
306,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Me. I have a book coming out.,
307,5.0,5.0,Driver,- You wrote a book!  ,

309,5.0,5.0,Driver,- That's amazing! Congratulations. ,
310,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Thank you.,
311,5.0,5.0,Carrie,It was kind of amazing. Why did I need a stranger to remind me of that?,
312,5.0,5.0,Driver,- Where can I take you? ,
313,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- Home. 73rd and...  ,
314,5.0,5.0,Driver,"- No, we have to celebrate this.",
315,5.0,5.0,Driver,"Come on, rapido, Papi.",
316,5.0,5.0,Driver,- I want to tell him.  ,
317,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"- Oh, no, I don't...",
318,5.0,5.0,Driver,She wrote a book.,
319,5.0,5.0,Hotdog vendor,"No kidding! Congratulations. Gonna be in the bookstores and everything? That's great. If that's the case, then tonight, the hot dogs are on me.",
320,5.0,5.0,Carrie,- You don't have to... ,
321,5.0,5.0,Hotdog vendor,- The dogs are on me. I insist.,
322,5.0,5.0,Driver,- Thanks.  ,
323,5.0,5.0,Hotdog vendor,- Sure. Have a nice weekend.,
324,5.0,5.0,Carrie,"All I could think was, who needs a Berger when you can get a fabulous hot dog for 75 cents or free? Then again, maybe there is something to knowing they're out there.",
0,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"In the life of a New Yorker, there are several unpleasant things one will inevitably have to face: Having your purse stolen, random public urination, and seeing a gay friend's boyfriend in a Broadway revue.",
1,5.0,6.0,Carrie,I think I understand the three-drink minimum now.,
2,5.0,6.0,Stanford,You're not enjoying the revue?,
3,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Frankly, I'm more concerned about my own review in the Times.",
4,5.0,6.0,Stanford,"Oh, my God, right, your book's reviewed this week. You must be so excited.",
5,5.0,6.0,Carrie,More like terrified. Michiko Kakutani. She's the Times' book critic.,
6,5.0,6.0,Stanford,I thought you were suggesting an appetizer.,
7,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"- She's brilliant, and she's really tough. ",
8,5.0,6.0,Stanford,- And impossible to pronounce.,
9,5.0,6.0,Carrie,I think they're bringing us home.,
10,5.0,6.0,Stanford,How could you not love this? Look at my boyfriend. He's gorgeous.,
11,5.0,6.0,Carrie,And he can kick.,
12,5.0,6.0,Stanford,Bravo!,
13,5.0,6.0,Announcer,Thank you. My boys Marcus Adante...,
14,5.0,6.0,Stanford,"Isn't he great? He's great, don't you think?",
15,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- I have to go to the ladies' room.  ,
16,5.0,6.0,Stanford,- Now? They're gonna do an encore.,
17,5.0,6.0,Carrie,I have to go to the ladies' room.,
18,5.0,6.0,Announcer,Broadway's best: Debbie Cass.,
19,5.0,6.0,Woman,"Who would have thought the phrase, ""Go see your cousin Debbie's club act"" could contain such horror?",
20,5.0,6.0,Woman 2,"I thought there'd be at least one straight guy here. I mean, if not in the audience, then at least behind the bar.",
21,5.0,6.0,Woman,"Hold on, 'cause Tomorrow, we're gonna cruise the cute pretzel guys at the Village Square Market.",
22,5.0,6.0,Woman,Is that as sad as that just sounded?,
23,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"If it makes you feel any better, I had a thing for the Amish guys who make hairbrushes.",
24,5.0,6.0,Woman,"Hi, you're Carrie Bradshaw.",
25,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Yeah, have we met?",
26,5.0,6.0,Woman,I recognized you from your column. And I went out with Aidan right after you.,
27,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"There I was, worried about the New York Times when apparently I'd already been reviewed.",
28,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"I'm telling you, it was a hit-and-run. No, it was a face-and-run.",
29,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"Make it again. Yeah, that ain't good.",
30,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,"I think you're being oversensitive, and it was a facial spasm or something. A lot of people have them, like Bell's palsy.",
31,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"No, it was not Bell's palsy. It was a full-frontal attack of the face like: ""Wow, was he messed up. You really screwed him up good.""",
32,5.0,6.0,Samantha,What did you say to her?,
33,5.0,6.0,Carrie,I didn't have time to say anything. She just ran out of the bathroom.,
34,5.0,6.0,Miranda,Fuck that fucking face girl.,
35,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"- Well, when you put it like that...  ",
36,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- I'm sorry.,
37,5.0,6.0,Miranda,I haven't slept for days. Brady's been crying non-stop.,
38,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- You poor thing. Can I do anything? ,
39,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- Put me out of my misery.,
40,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,What's wrong with him? Is he sick?,
41,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"No, he's not sick. He's not hungry, he's not teething, he just wants to scream. I'm doing everything I can, but I can't please him. If he was 35, this is when we would break up.",
42,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"He has issues, clearly.",
43,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"I'm telling you, this 13-pound meatloaf is pushing me over the edge.",

45,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"That reminds me, I have to confirm my appointment with John Mandy at the John Mandy Salon. You have no idea how hard it was to get this appointment. Hi, it's Samantha Jones. I'm calling to confirm my appointment Saturday for a cut-and-color with John. Thanks. Crisis averted.",
46,5.0,6.0,Miranda,Magda is waiting for me. Time to go back to prison.,
47,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,- Let me come with you. I can help.  ,
48,5.0,6.0,Mir,- You don't have to do that.,
49,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,"No, it's okay. Actually, I have a few questions because I'm meeting with the divorce lawyer on Monday.",
50,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Ask him if I could get an injunction to stop a face.,
51,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- Who did you get? ,
52,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,- Matthew Bloom of Bloom & Goldenblatt. What's he like?,
53,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"- He's smart, he's tough. ",
54,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,- But is he tough enough to beat Bunny to a pulp?,
55,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- Yeah. ,
56,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,"- Good. Okay, great. Bye, guys. Have a nice day.",
57,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Miranda, call me if you need anything.",
58,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Damn! Why is that girl still bothering me?,
59,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"Honey, you have to let it go. If I worried what every bitch in New York said about me, I'd never leave the house.",
60,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Early Monday morning, Charlotte met with her lawyer. He was smart, tough, and gorgeous.",
61,5.0,6.0,Matthew Bloom,"You said you had some bad feelings about your mother-in-law, Bunny MacDougal.",
62,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,Did I?,
63,5.0,6.0,Matthew Bloom,I get a sense from her lawyer this is going to be a bit of a battle.,
64,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"It was a battle, all right. The battle of the Charlottes. The Charlotte who wanted to seem attractive to her adorable lawyer and the Charlotte who wanted to kick Bunny MacDougal's ass.",
65,5.0,6.0,Matthew Bloom,It looks to me that Mrs. MacDougal has been very busy hiding assets to make sure you don't get anything.,
66,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,I just really want what was promised. I want my apartment.,
67,5.0,6.0,Matthew Bloom,"Technically, it's not your apartment. Trey's family owns it. She was very careful to ensure your name was not on the deed.",
68,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,"What? Trey gave me that apartment. Sorry. Usually, I'm a very refined person.",
69,5.0,6.0,Matthew Bloom,"With your husband out of the country, I'm gonna need you to be more specific.",
70,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Charlotte realized she could never be as ugly as she needed to be in front of a man she considered so handsome.,x
71,5.0,6.0,Harry,Sorry to bust in. There's a bagel here with my name on it.,
72,5.0,6.0,Matthew Bloom,"My partner, Harry. Harry, Charlotte York. I'm handling her divorce.",
73,5.0,6.0,Harry,How you doing? You're in the right hands here. He's a killer. Who the hell ordered blueberry bagels? I'm talking to Thelma about this. Good luck to you.,
74,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,"Is he a killer, too?",
75,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"And just like that, Charlotte changed lawyers.",
76,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"After a grueling day, which included leg, eyebrow, and bikini waxes, Samantha decided to reward herself with a night of R and R. Unfortunately, her favorite vibrator needed a little CPR.",
77,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"Brady, please. What? I cannot read your mind.",
78,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- Who is it? ,
79,5.0,6.0,Kendall,- 4-D. It's 2:30 in the morning.,
80,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- I know. I'm sorry. ,
81,5.0,6.0,Kendall,- You gotta stop that baby from crying.,
82,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"I said I was sorry, but I have a baby and sometimes babies make noise. That's what they do.",
83,5.0,6.0,Kendall,"I know that. I have a baby, too. And if you ever bothered to say hello in the elevator, you'd know that. I'm Kendall, my baby is Alika. Have a nice night.",
84,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Evidently, Miranda had been getting bad reviews from inside her own building.",
85,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"As for my review, I guess I was pretty nervous.",
86,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- Times. ,
87,5.0,6.0,Newstand vendor,- Thank you.,
88,5.0,6.0,Carrie,I hadn't been up this early since Princess Diana's wedding.,
89,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Good morning.,
90,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"""All in all, I enjoyed spending time in Ms. Bradshaw's sharp, funny, finely-drawn world where single women rule, and the men are disposable."" Ouch!",
91,5.0,6.0,Miranda,I believe what you have there is a rave review from the New York Times.,
92,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"- ""The men are disposable""? I don't dispose of men, do I? ",
93,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- No.,
94,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"- Michiko Kakutani thinks so, and I always agree with her. ",
95,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- Fuck Michiko Kakutani.,
96,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- No sleep again? ,
97,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"- Actually, it was a good night. I got a whole hour. I can't believe I have to go and pretend to be a lawyer now. Can I wear a baseball cap to work?",
98,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"With what shoes? My God, listen to me going on and on about Michiko Kakutani when you have real problems. So can I obsess for another minute?",
99,5.0,6.0,Miranda,Just don't say her name again. It'll push me over the edge.,
100,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"So, yes, some of the men in the book are maybe a little disposable, but this makes it sound like I think men are disposable in life. What? What's with the pause?",
101,5.0,6.0,Miranda,I'm sorry. I fell asleep for a second.,
102,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"That's a terrible thing to think about me. Oh, my God, that's what the face meant. Do you think that Aidan thinks that I think he was disposable?",
103,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"Carrie, you did not throw Aidan away.",
104,5.0,6.0,Magda,Good morning.,
105,5.0,6.0,Carrie,That girl thinks I did. He must have said something like that to her. Where else would she get it? Steve and Aidan are close. Has Steve ever said anything to you? Does Steve hate me now?,
106,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"Carrie, you're spinning. Steve doesn't hate you.",
107,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Then how come I never see him anymore?,
108,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"You never see him because I have to keep him away. Because if I see him now, I'll ask him to marry me just to give me some help.",
109,5.0,6.0,Carrie,I worked very hard at taking care of Aidan's feelings. Will you mention that to Steve? Because if Aidan told Steve...,
110,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"Carrie, you know what? Maybe you should call your girlfriend Samantha. She has all kinds of time to talk about this kind of stuff. I know it's me and I'm jealous of her free time and all, but if she could maybe just once acknowledge the fact that I've had a baby... It's not enough I've alienated my neighbor. Now I'm alienating my friends.",
111,5.0,6.0,Carrie,You're not alienating anyone.,
112,5.0,6.0,Miranda,Tell that to 4-D. She's pissed off I don't know her name. Do you know your neighbors' names?,
113,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Please.,
114,5.0,6.0,Miranda,I'm a bad neighbor and a bad mother.,
115,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- That's not true. You're doing great. ,
116,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"- Yeah, right.",
117,5.0,6.0,Carrie,You're just having a bad week. Can I do anything to help?,
118,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"That helps, just asking. I'm late. I gotta go. Congratulations on the review.",
119,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Why is it that we only seem to believe the negative things people say about us, no matter how much evidence there is to the contrary? A neighbor, a face, an ex-boyfriend can cancel out everything we thought was once true. Odd, but when it comes to life and love, why do we believe our worst reviews?",
120,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"After a long day in court, Miranda faced another jury.",
121,5.0,6.0,Miranda,Don't cry.,
122,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"And at City Bakery, Samantha and I were reviewing the desserts.",
123,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Delish. I'll buy you dessert if you do something for me.,
124,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- I'm not eating desserts this week. ,
125,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"- Come on, best brownies in New York.",
126,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- Bastard. I'll take a brownie. What do you need me to do? ,
127,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- It's about Miranda and the baby.,
128,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- Forget the brownie.  ,
129,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"- No, she'll take the brownie.",
130,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"Babies are not my scene. And from what I've heard, this one sounds like an asshole.",
131,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- You can't call a baby an asshole. ,
132,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- Why not? She called it a meatloaf.,
133,5.0,6.0,Carrie,I don't think it would kill all of us to be a little more supportive.,
134,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"All right. When he's in college, I'll take him for a drink and flirt with his friends. How's that?",
135,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Maybe you could just stop by Tomorrow and say: ""I hear you had a baby. How's that going?""",
136,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"I have no time. I'm booked all day. I have my hair appointment, and I'm returning a vibrator before that.",
137,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Hair and a vibrator?,
138,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"Yes, that is my life, and I don't have to justify it. I hate it when people have babies and they suddenly expect you turn into a Norman Rockwell painting.",
139,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"We're not talking about people, we're talking about our friend. And she's sinking.",
140,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"What, so, Miranda's like Venice?",
141,5.0,6.0,Cashier,That'll be $14.20.,
142,5.0,6.0,Carrie,She's paying for the brownie.,
143,5.0,6.0,Julia,- Carrie.  ,
144,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"- Julia, hi.",
145,5.0,6.0,Carrie,This is my friend Samantha. This is Julia Afton. We work together at Vogue.,
146,5.0,6.0,Julia,Hardly. She gets to run in and out once a month while I'm chained to the hem of Anna Wintour. There's my friend. Nina. I'm here. It is about time.,
147,5.0,6.0,Nina,"Sorry I'm late. Carrie, hi.",
148,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"There I was, face to face with the face girl.",
149,5.0,6.0,Julia,- How do you two know each other? ,
150,5.0,6.0,Nina,- I'll tell you over lunch.,
151,5.0,6.0,Nina,- Nina Katz.  ,
152,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- hi. Samantha Jones.,
153,5.0,6.0,Nina,"- Hi, nice to see you again. Can we eat? I'm starvation central. ",
154,5.0,6.0,Julia,- Okey-dokey. See you.,
155,5.0,6.0,Nina,"Bye, Carrie.",
156,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- How do you know Nina Katz?  ,
157,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- How do you know Nina Katz?,
158,5.0,6.0,Samantha,Everybody knows Nina Katz. She's the booker for Saturday Night Live.,
159,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- She's also the face girl. ,
160,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- No! Nina Katz is the...,
161,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- Exactly. Great. That face will be all over Vogue.  ,
162,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- Not to mention SNL. Nina Katz loves to talk.,
163,5.0,6.0,Cashier,$15.30.,
164,5.0,6.0,Carrie,I'm going to need a big brownie as well.,
165,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"The next day, Samantha did some personal shopping. Very personal.",
166,5.0,6.0,Clerk,- Can I help you?  ,
167,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"- Yes, I'd like to return this vibrator.",
168,5.0,6.0,Clerk,- We don't sell vibrators. ,
169,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"- Yes, you do. I bought it here six months ago.",
170,5.0,6.0,Clerk,- That's not a vibrator. It's a neck massager.  ,
171,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"- No, it's a vibrator.",
172,5.0,6.0,Clerk,Sharper lmage doesn't sell vibrators. It's a neck massager.,
173,5.0,6.0,Samantha,You expect me to believe that women buy these to help their sore necks?,
174,5.0,6.0,Clerk,- It's a neck massager.  ,
175,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- Fine. I'd like to return this neck massager.,
176,5.0,6.0,Clerk,What's wrong with it?,
177,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"It failed to get me off. It has a warranty, and it just stopped. Made the saddest little sound.",
178,5.0,6.0,Clerk,- Perhaps you wore it out.  ,
179,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"- Honey, it wouldn't be the first one.",
180,5.0,6.0,Clerk,"Fine. Just find another, and go to the cashier.",
181,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"I know a man who's in desperate need of a neck massage. You don't want that one. Too many bells and whistles. That one actually works against you. If we wanted to work that hard, we'd get us a man. Am I right?",
182,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Samantha instantly established herself as the Michiko Kakutani of vibrators.,
183,5.0,6.0,Woman,I think that one actually is a back massager.,
184,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"Not if you mount it. No, absolutely not. That will burn your clit off.",
185,5.0,6.0,Woman 2,- Even with underwear? ,
186,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- Even with ski pants.,
187,5.0,6.0,Kendall,I brought you something. It belongs to Alika. An oscillating chair. It helps.,
188,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- Come on in. ,
189,5.0,6.0,Kendall,"- Hey, there, Mr. Mouth. What have you got to say that is so important?",
190,5.0,6.0,Miranda,I'm sorry. It's just been non-stop.,
191,5.0,6.0,Kendall,"Now, this chair is a little controversial, but I don't give a shit. 'Cause it stopped my baby from crying when I was about ready to throw myself off the fire escape.",
192,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"Sounds good. Oh, my God! The chair is genius.",
193,5.0,6.0,Kendall,Something about the vibration... I don't know. They love it. Alika could sit in it for hours. How come you haven't heard about this? Don't your girlfriends have babies?,
194,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"- No, I'm the only one. ",
195,5.0,6.0,Kendall,- Then you're screwed.,
196,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"Actually, they've been very helpful.",
197,5.0,6.0,Kendall,"If they don't have kids, they don't have a clue. Miranda, you're not a bad mother. You just didn't have the chair.",
198,5.0,6.0,Miranda,Thank you... Kendall.,
199,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Three blissful baby hours later…,
200,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"Samantha, what're you doing here?",
201,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"I'm not Samantha, you are. You have a 5:30 appointment with John Mandy at the John Mandy Salon. Go.",
202,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- What? I can't take your...  ,
203,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"- I'm counting to five, then I'm changing my mind.",
204,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- Really? You want to baby-sit?  ,
205,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"- Five, four...",
206,5.0,6.0,Miranda,Okay. I don't know what to say. I can't believe it.,
207,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"Neither can I, but here I am, Mary fucking Poppins.",
208,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"Thank you. The numbers are on the fridge, and don't take him out of that chair. It's the only thing that keeps him quiet. And don't call boys.",
209,5.0,6.0,Samantha,You don't look so bad.,
210,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, in a chair across town, I was enjoying an afternoon of absolutely nothing.",
211,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Do you think Nina Katz is telling random celebrity hosts that I'm the bad-breakup girlfriend?,
212,5.0,6.0,Samantha,What?,
213,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"You said she loved to talk. Do you think she's trashing me to, say, a Gwyneth Paltrow or an lan McKellen?",
214,5.0,6.0,Samantha,You can't be serious.,
215,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Don't get me wrong. I don't flatter myself that a Gwyneth Paltrow or an lan McKellen would be interested in my love life. Are you at a zoo?,
216,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"No, thanks to you, I am at Miranda's and Brady won't stop screaming, and I don't know what to do.",
217,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- You're at Miranda's? ,
218,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- I sent her to get my haircut.,
219,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- That was nice.  ,
220,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"- Yes, and now I'm being punished.",
221,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- So he's not hurt? ,
222,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- No.,
223,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- Or wet? ,
224,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- No.,
225,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- Then I don't know what his problem is. ,
226,5.0,6.0,Samantha,- His problem is he's an asshole.,
227,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Maybe you should call Miranda.,
228,5.0,6.0,Samantha,I will not. It took me months to get that appointment. Someone should benefit. I'll find some way to keep this kid quiet. Goodbye.,
229,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"No, wait, what about Nina?",
230,5.0,6.0,Samantha,Maybe Charlotte has the time to talk about this kind of stuff. I have a screaming baby on my hands. What? What do you need?,
231,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"Well, that's better.",
232,5.0,6.0,Miranda,- Is everything okay? ,
233,5.0,6.0,Samantha,"- Absolutely. The chair thing broke. But, you know, shit happens.",
234,5.0,6.0,Miranda,"The chair broke? But what did you... I mean, did he... That better be brand-new.",
235,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Monday morning, Harry did his best to make sure Bunny didn't hop all over Charlotte.",
236,5.0,6.0,Allan,Mrs. MacDougal is willing to offer her son's collection of mint-condition silver Buffalo coins.,
237,5.0,6.0,Harry,Could we get off the coin collection? She's not going to settle for coin collection.,
238,5.0,6.0,Allan,According to the pre-nup...,
239,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,This is ridiculous. Trey gave me that apartment.,
240,5.0,6.0,Bunny,She gave him her word. Till death do them part.,
241,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,"Bunny, if you have something to say to me...",
242,5.0,6.0,Bunny,- Fine. I shall. ,
243,5.0,6.0,Allan,- I strongly recommend...,
244,5.0,6.0,Bunny,"Allan, hush. You, my dear, took a vow. And when things didn't go your way, you simply broke that vow. I come from a generation of women that valued marriage. We believed in ""for better or for worse."" Not ""for better, or until the road gets rocky."" When I think of the heartache and shame you caused my dear boy... I'm amazed that you could even come here and look me in the face.",
245,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Charlotte couldn't fight any more. It seemed to her she'd been fighting for this marriage forever.,
246,5.0,6.0,Bunny,"Be advised, young lady, I'm more than prepared to go to court.",
247,5.0,6.0,Allan,It's the coin collection. Take it or leave it.,
248,5.0,6.0,Harry,"Just hold on. Apparently, our office received a telegram from Scotland from Dr. MacDougal. Shall I read it?",
249,5.0,6.0,Bunny,By all means.,
250,5.0,6.0,Harry,"""Charlotte York was a wonderful wife. Stop.She did nothing wrong. Stop. Give her everything she wants. Stop. Seriously, Mother. Stop.""",
251,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"That's the thing about reviews. Sometimes, when you least expect it, you get a rave.",
252,5.0,6.0,Allan,Just the apartment.,
253,5.0,6.0,Harry,"I'll have papers drawn up, so Mrs. MacDougal can transfer the deed.",
254,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Even though things had gotten ugly, Charlotte didn't want them to end that way.",
255,5.0,6.0,Charlotte,I'm sorry things didn't work out better for all of us.,
256,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Charlotte realized there was no such thing as a fairy-tale divorce either.,
257,5.0,6.0,Harry,"""Ding dong, the witch is dead.""",
258,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"And farther uptown, still unable to let it go, Nina Katz and that face had driven me to face my worst fear.",
259,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"So, Steve, I know I was kind of vague on the phone...",
260,5.0,6.0,Steve,"It's Miranda, right? She doesn't want me to call her so much. It's fine.",
261,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"No, it's not about Miranda. It's about... How does Aidan feel about me?",
262,5.0,6.0,Steve,"Jeez, no. You're not going to try to get back together with him again, are you?",
263,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"No, but that pretty much answers any question I had about how you feel. So, what, does he hate me?",
264,5.0,6.0,Steve,"No, but come on, Carrie, it was pretty bad.",
265,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"- How bad? Steve, the ball. ",
266,5.0,6.0,Steve,- Sorry.,
267,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- How is he now?  ,
268,5.0,6.0,Steve,- Great. He's great.,
269,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- Good. ,
270,5.0,6.0,Steve,"- Now. But back then, he couldn't get out of bed for like...",
271,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"- What? Days, weeks?  ",
272,5.0,6.0,Steve,"- Like, a month. I brought him chicken wings.",
273,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"- Oh, Christ.  ",
274,5.0,6.0,Steve,- I don't mean to make you feel bad. ,
275,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- A month?,
276,5.0,6.0,Steve,"Yeah, he was devastated. He lost his ability to open up and trust women.",
277,5.0,6.0,Carrie,He lost his ability to open up and trust women? Did he tell you that?,
278,5.0,6.0,Steve,"No, guys don't talk about shit like that. We just ate wings. But the girl, Nina, he was dating, she told me that.",
279,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Okay, we're looking for the cute pretzel guys.",
280,5.0,6.0,Stanford,How come you never wanted to cruise guys when I was available?,
281,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"This isn't about cruising, it's about clarity. That face chick is hitting a little too close to home. I want to find her and tell her my side of the breakup story.",
282,5.0,6.0,Stanford,Why? You know what you and Aidan had.,
283,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"I know it, but she doesn't.And she's yip-yapping her version all over town. It only takes one bad review to cancel out all the good word-of-mouth.",
284,5.0,6.0,Stanford,What do you think of Marcus?,
285,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Nice. I mean, relationships are complicated. You can't reduce them to a face. I know that Aidan has feelings...",
286,5.0,6.0,Stanford,"Okay, stop. I am done. I've listened to you talk about Aidan, for what...ten blocks, and two years? And I've been a wonderful audience. And I ask you about my Marcus, and all I get is ""nice""?",
287,5.0,6.0,Carrie,I'm sorry.,
288,5.0,6.0,Stanford,How many relationships have I been in since you've known me?,
289,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Real or imaginary?,
290,5.0,6.0,Stanford,"Come on, your opinion means a lot to me. You're my Machiko Kakamatsa.",
291,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"So, now what, you want me to review your relationship?",
292,5.0,6.0,Stanford,"- Immediately, if not sooner. ",

297,5.0,6.0,Nina,"- Sorry. Heather, this is Carrie Bradshaw.  ",
298,5.0,6.0,Heather,"- Carrie Bradshaw, really?",
299,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"I need to talk to you for a second, alone, if I can.",
300,5.0,6.0,Stanford,"Miss Graham, may I buy you a pretzel?",
301,5.0,6.0,Heather,- Okay.  ,
302,5.0,6.0,Nina,- Get me one.,
303,5.0,6.0,Heather,- A man or a pretzel?  ,
304,5.0,6.0,Nina,- Whatever has less carbs.  ,
305,5.0,6.0,Heather,- Right.,
306,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"I get the sense that you have a sort of feeling about what happened with Aidan, and I just want to clear something up. Breakups are awful, and they are private. And they are not necessarily sympTomatic of what two people had together. I loved Aidan very much. And I would never, ever have done anything to deliberately hurt him.",
307,5.0,6.0,Nina,Okay.,
308,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"Suddenly, I realized the critic I was most afraid of wasn't Nina Katz. It was me.",
309,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"So, bye.",
310,5.0,6.0,Carrie,"The truth is, at any given moment, someone, somewhere could be making a face about you. But it's the reviews you give yourself that matter.",
311,5.0,6.0,Stanford,"...with Heather Graham and I'm like, ""Shit, what do we have to talk about?""",
312,5.0,6.0,Carrie,- Being pretty. ,
313,5.0,6.0,Stanford,- I know. But we had nothing to talk about but pretzels. So I said...,
314,5.0,6.0,Carrie,Come on.,
315,5.0,6.0,Stanford,"I said, ""Have you ever been to Bavaria? They make the best pretzels there.""",
0,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"One night, four ladies in the east met at Compass to discuss going west.",
1,5.0,7.0,Carrie,I have to go to San Francisco on a book tour.,
2,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"You wouldn't go to the Upper West Side. Suddenly, you're going to San Francisco?",
3,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"They're making me. Apparently, I'm very big in San Francisco.",
4,5.0,7.0,Miranda,"You mean, Big is in San Francisco.",
5,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Okay, yes, perhaps I'll see Big. Guys, I need to have sex. It's been too long. Lately, I've been having these dreams where I run. I run up to complete strangers and just start kissing them.",
6,5.0,7.0,Miranda,No need to go across the country for sex. Go across the restaurant. Those guys have been checking us out ever since they sat down.,
7,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,- Cute. ,
8,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"- Boring, boring and boring. Like these scallops.",
9,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,- I love the food here. ,
10,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"- Same old, same old.",
11,5.0,7.0,Carrie,Same old? It just opened last week.,
12,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"Scallops are scallops, and bachelors are bachelors.",
13,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Sounds to me like you might be experiencing a ""been there, done them"" existential crisis.",
14,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"It's not me, it's New York. Nothing is ever really new. In fact, they should change the name to ""Same York.""",
15,5.0,7.0,Miranda,"You're nuts. These scallops are fantastic, and those guys are cute.",
16,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,You should go say hi. May I?,
17,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"No, I don't want to say hi. I want to say: ""Could one of you lie on top of me for a while?"" I need to feel the weight of a man on me.",
18,5.0,7.0,Miranda,"At times like this, I wish women could go to male prostitutes.",
19,5.0,7.0,Samantha,Women do.,
20,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"No, only in bad screenplays and first novels.",
21,5.0,7.0,Miranda,"That is an incredible investment idea. We should open a brothel where the men are cute, and the sheets are 500-count Egyptian cotton. Samantha, you can be the madam.",
22,5.0,7.0,Samantha,At least it's something new.,
23,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"We could put one in every neighborhood, like Starbucks.",
24,5.0,7.0,Samantha,Starfucks.,
25,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,"Such a place doesn't exist in reality because women don't think about sex like that. It's not an animal urge. We need to feel things. We need a connection. Isn't that right, Carrie?",
26,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"No, Big is my male prostitute. I am mixing business with much-needed pleasure. And my relief is just a train ride away.",
27,5.0,7.0,Miranda,A train? Why don't you just fly?,
28,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"No, flying makes me nervous. I get uneasy seeing the National Guard go through my makeup case. Besides, it'll be fun. Especially if Samantha goes with me. Please, come on, it'll be hilarious.",
29,5.0,7.0,Carrie,Two gals on a train. Very Some Like It Hot. And the whole trip ends with a luxury suite in a fabulous four-star San Francisco hotel.,
30,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,Why didn't you invite me?,
31,5.0,7.0,Carrie,Because Samantha is the only one who's bored enough to do it.,
32,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"- So what time do we leave ""Same York""? ",
33,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- I'm gonna get laid.,
34,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"More and more single women of a certain age are looking for a certain thing. And that certain thing does not necessarily involve a certain ring. We may have traded the little black book for a little black dress, and replaced the Ferrari with a Fendi. But in view of certain evidence, I had to wonder: Are we the new bachelors?",
35,5.0,7.0,Samantha,What did Big say when you told him?,
36,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"I haven't yet. I'm gonna wait till I get there. You know, ""Hello, guess where I am."" Very casual, very...",
37,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"That's one approach. I would have called and said: ""I'm coming, and I won't be the only one.""",

42,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Think of it as an adventure. ""It's not the destination, it's the journey."" A journey in adjoining, first-class, deluxe sleeper berths.",

44,5.0,7.0,Samantha,You never know who's going to be getting on and getting me off.,
45,5.0,7.0,Conductor,All aboard.,
46,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Hello, sir.",
47,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"We were supposed to have the deluxe, first-class sleeper.",
48,5.0,7.0,Conductor,This is the first-class sleeper.,
49,5.0,7.0,Samantha,And I suppose the regular class sleeps in what? A tuna can?,
50,5.0,7.0,Conductor,"Right here, you have your door to the restroom.",
51,5.0,7.0,Carrie,Wait. You shower over the toilet?,
52,5.0,7.0,Samantha,I'm starting to understand why there was a murder on the Orient Express.,

61,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,Excuse me?,
62,5.0,7.0,Harry,Outside. I'm schvitzing like a pudding at a picnic. This is the pagoda we've been fighting over. It's impressive. I can see why you'd never want to give it up.,
63,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,"- Actually, I'm thinking about selling.  ",
64,5.0,7.0,Harry,- After what we went through to get it?,
65,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,It's too big for one person. I'm putting the word out. If anyone knows a great apartment...,
66,5.0,7.0,Harry,I got a buddy who has a place. It may be a little too bachelor for your taste.,
67,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,I can change that. You should've seen this place earlier. It was where plaid furniture came to die.,
68,5.0,7.0,Harry,- I could set it up so you can get a first look.  ,
69,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,- Okay.,
70,5.0,7.0,Harry,"Done. So let's get you divorced. Sit, and sign.",
71,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,Do you have a handkerchief or something? You're still sweating.,

112,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,- Trey was not a putz.,

142,5.0,7.0,Anthony,- Cosmos for everyone!,
143,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,"- No, it's not good. I don't want to date him. He's not very attractive. ",
144,5.0,7.0,Anthony,- Ugly sex is hot.,
145,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,"No, he's sweaty and pushy. No, I could never date him. But maybe just for the sex. How does that work, exactly?",
146,5.0,7.0,Anthony,"Okay, listen up. You have to be very clear about the rules. It's just sex. You can't act romantic at all. You have to talk just sex talk. ""Fuck me, and get out.""",
147,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,- Isn't that rude? ,
148,5.0,7.0,Anthony,"- No, it's hot. Hello! Where's my drink?",
149,5.0,7.0,Samantha,Things are looking up. They are pretty cute.,
150,5.0,7.0,Carrie,This blush is worse than a pimple. I look like I'm in a high-school play or something.,
151,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"Come on, follow my lead. Hello. Aren't you boys a sight for sore eyes? So, what are we drinking?",
152,5.0,7.0,Man,Light beer.,
153,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"We can do better than that. Sir, a bottle of champagne, please. I'm sure one of you gentlemen will help me pop my cork.",
154,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"And just like that, we went from Some Like It Hot to Some Like Us Not.",
155,5.0,7.0,Samantha,- I thought I was looking pretty hot.,
156,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- You are pretty hot.,
157,5.0,7.0,Samantha,- Not according to them. ,
158,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Champagne.,
159,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"Excuse me, but what kind of bachelor party is this?",
160,5.0,7.0,Man,"We're not really bachelors. We're all married. Except Bri, he's the last one in the gang to bite it. Yeah, we're taking him to the Giants game in San Francisco.",
161,5.0,7.0,Carrie,My friend over there has come on this very long trip as a favor to me and I was hoping that one of you fellows could oblige her in a little harmless male flirtation.,
162,5.0,7.0,Man,We're trying to be good. Promised our wives.,
163,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"As far as a pimp, I was a total train wreck.",
164,5.0,7.0,Carrie,They love their wives.,
165,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"You were right, Carrie. It's not New York that's the problem, it's me. I am having an...The midlife thing, you know.",
166,5.0,7.0,Carrie,This thing has roots.,
167,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"And I don't know what I'm gonna do. I mean, I already fuck younger guys and I don't want a sports car. Oh, God, parking in New York is a bitch.",
168,5.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm sorry about the train. This was a terrible idea. It's all my fault. All because I had to get laid. There. Popped it.,
169,5.0,7.0,Samantha,All right! Let's get another bottle to celebrate.,
170,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"One very long trip later, Samantha and I dragged our cabooses into a bookstore near the Golden Gate.",
171,5.0,7.0,Samantha,Impressive turnout. I guess you are big in San Francisco.,
172,5.0,7.0,Carrie,My publisher.,
173,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Hi! ,
174,5.0,7.0,Lily,- You made it in one piece.,
175,5.0,7.0,Carrie,That's debatable. Wow! I can't believe it. All these people came to hear me read?,
176,5.0,7.0,Lily,They're not all just for you. Mr. Winkle's here.,
177,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Who's Mr. Winkle?  ,
178,5.0,7.0,Lily,- He's making an appearance right after you.,
179,5.0,7.0,Samantha,You're opening for a dog?,
180,5.0,7.0,Lily,"They had a chance to get Mr. Winkle, and they jumped at it. He's huge on the Internet.",
181,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Lily, I can't be the opening act for a dog.",
182,5.0,7.0,Lily,What can I say? The West Coast sales rep totally fucked me on this.,
183,5.0,7.0,Man,"- Lily, hi! ",
184,5.0,7.0,Lily,"- One sec, I'll be right back.",
185,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"You know, maybe...",
186,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Thanks, but don't even waste your energy. You know, go back to the hotel, and get in that giant tub and relax. I'll see you later, we'll have a meal.",
187,5.0,7.0,Samantha,Later? Aren't you going to call Big?,
188,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Between the pimple and the puppy, I'm not up for it.",
189,5.0,7.0,Samantha,- Are you sure? ,
190,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"- Yeah, go. Take a long bath.",
191,5.0,7.0,Samantha,- I may never get out.  ,
192,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Bye.,
193,5.0,7.0,Carrie,This book tour stuff is rough. That's a cute top.,
194,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"""As I walked home, I couldn't help but wonder: Was it Big, was it New York or was it me?"" Does anyone have a question? Yes?",
195,5.0,7.0,Fan,When is Mr. Winkle coming out?,
196,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"In a mere moment. So, if there are no other questions about my book...Yes, I see a hand, but I can't see the man. Could you shift? Sorry.",
197,5.0,7.0,Big,"Yes, I have a question. This Big character, does he have a real name?",
198,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yes, but I can't reveal it. I have to protect his privacy.",
199,5.0,7.0,Carrie,I no longer cared about Mr. Winkle. I had Big.,
200,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Samantha! ,
201,5.0,7.0,Samantha,- I'm taking a bubble bath.,
202,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"- You have to get out. Big's here, I need to have sex. ",
203,5.0,7.0,Samantha,- I'm taking a bath.,
204,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- I got you a smaller room all to yourself downstairs. ,
205,5.0,7.0,Samantha,- I can't get in another small room.,
206,5.0,7.0,Carrie,Please. I have to get laid.,
207,5.0,7.0,Samantha,You better fuck him good. I'm not gonna go through this again in another six months.,
208,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Can you hurry? I told him to come up in about half an hour. So, snap it up. Faster. Okay, bye-bye. Thank you, sweets.",
209,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"- God. Hey, you. ",
210,5.0,7.0,Big,"- So, did you hide the body? ",
211,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- What body?,
212,5.0,7.0,Big,Or whatever it was you had to do that kept me wandering around the hotel gift shop for half an hour. I got you some gum. Big Red. The clerk recommended it.,
213,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Aren't you something? Want some?  ,
214,5.0,7.0,Big,- Sure.,
215,5.0,7.0,Big,- Nice digs. This will set your publisher back. ,
216,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Yeah. You look good.,
217,5.0,7.0,Big,"- So do you, kid. ",
218,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- What?,
219,5.0,7.0,Big,My gum. Christ. You surprised me. I swallowed it.,
220,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Sorry. Here, let me kiss it and make it all better. How's that?",
221,5.0,7.0,Big,- We better go. Dinner reservations.  ,
222,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- I'm not hungry.,
223,5.0,7.0,Big,We have to go. I promised my partners I'd make a vineyard connection with the restaurant owner. So let's go. We'll have a nice meal and catch up.,
224,5.0,7.0,Carrie,Okay.,
225,5.0,7.0,Big,"So, I'm walking through the mall, and I see your book.",
226,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Wait, you were in a mall?",
227,5.0,7.0,Big,"I live in America now. You've gotta go through them to get to the outside. Anyway, I pass a bookstore, and there you are, right in the window next to the real books.",
228,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"- Sir, you are too kind. ",
229,5.0,7.0,Big,- Good cover. Cute. Sexy. ,
230,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Sexy?,
231,5.0,7.0,Big,"So, I go in. I bought it, drove right home, sat on my porch, lit up a cigar, and I read it cover to cover.",
232,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Porch? ,
233,5.0,7.0,Big,- Screen doors and everything.,
234,5.0,7.0,Carrie,What do you think?,
235,5.0,7.0,Big,"I had no idea that I hurt you so much. I gotta say, it was tough to see it in print.",
236,5.0,7.0,Carrie,You've read my columns.,
237,5.0,7.0,Big,"Not all at one sitting, one reading, one right after the other. I really got how much I hurt you.",
238,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Come on, that's fiction. I embellished.",
239,5.0,7.0,Big,"No, some of that stuff really happened. Word for word.",
240,5.0,7.0,Carrie,It's just writing. It's all in the past. Let's forget all that and talk about something else. How's the wine business?,
241,5.0,7.0,Big,- Great. ,
242,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Yeah?,
243,5.0,7.0,Big,You know that chapter about my apartment key? Was I really that big of an asshole?,
244,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Oh, my God.",
245,5.0,7.0,Big,"""He was like the city itself, cold, infuriating and exhausting.""",
246,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Suddenly, it became clear to me: This was not my best-laid plan.",
247,5.0,7.0,Big,"See, that's what I'm talking about. When have I ever been cold? Am I cold?",
248,5.0,7.0,Carrie,No. You're hot. Very hot.,
249,5.0,7.0,Big,- What about Chapter 3? ,
250,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- That was all years ago. Can we please stop talking?,
251,5.0,7.0,Big,- Wait.  ,
252,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- What?,
253,5.0,7.0,Big,- I just don't want you to get hurt again. ,
254,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- I won't. It's just sex.,
255,5.0,7.0,Big,"According to this book, it is not just sex.",
256,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"What happened in New York was all my fault. I didn't read the signs. You were unavailable, and very clear about that. It was all me. Now, please, kiss me. Or at least lie on top of me.",
257,5.0,7.0,Big,"Carrie, I think it's very clear from this book that when it comes to me, you do not have good judgment. Now, look at Chapter 3.",
258,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- That's fiction. And it's not even a bestseller. ,
259,5.0,7.0,Big,"- Here, page 39.",
260,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Oh, God. I can't believe this is happening. Are you involved with someone else?  ",
261,5.0,7.0,Big,- No. ,
262,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"It's the pimple, isn't it?",
263,5.0,7.0,Big,I just don't want to do something here that I'll be sorry for later.,
264,5.0,7.0,Carrie,I'm fine. Look at me. Put the book down and look at me. I'm fine. Just fine. Don't I look fine?,
265,5.0,7.0,Big,"Let's talk just a little more. Now, look, page 39. This part.",
266,5.0,7.0,Harry,- I love making love to you. ,
267,5.0,7.0,Charlotte,- No. That was not love. That was just sex.,
268,5.0,7.0,Harry,"Charlotte, you are so beautiful. Your skin is so soft. So smooth.",
269,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"And you... have a hard dick. Now, put your pants on and go. Is that okay?",
270,5.0,7.0,Harry,Whatever you say.,
271,5.0,7.0,Carrie,There they were: The bachelorette and the beast.,
272,5.0,7.0,Harry,What about dinner Saturday night?,
273,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- This is just sex. We're not a couple. You're just...a great fuck. Is that clear?  ,
274,5.0,7.0,Harry,- Clear.,

278,5.0,7.0,Phone,7:30.,

280,5.0,7.0,Phone,- 7:30.  ,
281,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Okay. Thank you.,
282,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"After my wake-up call, I got my real wake-up call. Thanks to my book, nothing was ever going to happen with Big.",

285,5.0,7.0,Big,- Not so fast. Come here. ,
286,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Now? What about last night? All that talk? All those concerns?,
287,5.0,7.0,Mar,Fuck it. You'll need material for the sequel.,
288,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"""Like that freckle on my face that he once told me he loved. I could do my best to cover it during the day, but at night, after I washed the city off my face, there it was, a tiny brown dot near the tip of my lip. And I wondered how something so small could suddenly seem so big.""",
289,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- Here you go. ,

295,5.0,7.0,Samantha,Hallelujah.,
296,5.0,7.0,Carrie,"Yeah, but it was not as simple as I had hoped.",
297,5.0,7.0,Samantha,What does that mean?,
298,5.0,7.0,Carrie,The question-and-answer section of this reading is now over. I'll tell you on the train.,
299,5.0,7.0,Samantha,"Train? Get real. American Airlines, first-class, and some Valium. I cannot wait to get to New York.",
300,5.0,7.0,Carrie,- What about the midlife crisis?  ,

23,5.0,8.0,Samantha,- Congratulations. Who's the lucky stud? ,
24,5.0,8.0,Bobby Fine,- Me.,
25,5.0,8.0,Carrie,You're getting married?,
26,5.0,8.0,Bobby Fine,Can you believe it? Bitsy and I are affianced. I finally found the right girl. Mr. Broadway has to go tinkle before he can tinkle.,
27,5.0,8.0,Bitsy,"- Samantha, I have your address. You have to come. Nice meeting you all. ",
28,5.0,8.0,Samantha,- Bye.,

31,5.0,8.0,Samantha,He must be marrying her for the money.,
32,5.0,8.0,Carrie,He doesn't need the money. He was one of the original investors in Chorus Line.,
33,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"Just when you thought you'd never hear anything gayer than ""Mr. Broadway has to go tinkle.""",
34,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,Why would he be getting married?,
35,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"In 1988, Bobby Fine announced that he was going to sell his piano bar downtown and go volunteer with Nicaraguan orphans. The orphans are still waiting. This wedding will never happen.",
36,5.0,8.0,Carrie,It's happening.,
37,5.0,8.0,Samantha,Everything's booked. So the really big question is where are we going to stay?,
38,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"That's the really big question? What about, ""Why are these two people marrying each other?"" Is that all there is?",
39,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,Bitsy said they were madly in love.,
40,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"You see, I find the love facade the most offensive part. We're adults. We can handle it. Bitsy should say, ""I'm getting older, and I want companionship."" Or Bobby should say, ""The hot men don't go for me anymore."" But don't print invitations and call it love as if love transforms people and changes molecules 'cause that's bullshit.",
41,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- I guess you don't want to be my date then. ,
42,5.0,8.0,Samantha,"- No dates, unless they have summer houses.",
43,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Relax. We can stay with Stanford and Marcus.,
44,5.0,8.0,Samantha,I was a fool to break up with Richard before Labor Day. He has a fabulous house.,
45,5.0,8.0,Miranda,I wouldn't go to this charade if you paid me. It's like there's a pink suede elephant in the middle of the room and nobody's allowed to talk about it.,
46,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,You think they won't have sex? ,
47,5.0,8.0,Samantha,All married couples stop having sex eventually.,
48,5.0,8.0,Miranda,That's not true. You've had sex with lots of married people. ,
49,5.0,8.0,Samantha,That's how I know.,
50,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Okay, let's say it's companionship. How do you sustain a relationship without the zsa zsa zsu?",
51,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,The what?,
52,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"That butterflies-in-your-sTomach thing that happens when you not only love the person, but you gotta have them. Isn't that what gets you through the years? Even if it fades, at least you have the memory of the zsa zsa zsu.",
53,5.0,8.0,Miranda,I'm fine with whatever people want to do. Just be straight with me.,
54,5.0,8.0,Carrie,I think that's how Bitsy proposed to Bobby.,
55,5.0,8.0,Carrie,It was right about then Charlotte decided to be straight with us.,
56,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,"- I'm seeing someone, sort of. ",
57,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"- You're in a ""sort of"" relationship?",
58,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- It's ridiculous. He's so not my type. ,
59,5.0,8.0,Miranda,- Is he heterosexual?,
60,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Yes. But he's bald and short, and he talks with his mouth full. I don't even want to be seen in public with him. I hate his name, Harry, because he is, everywhere but his head.",
61,5.0,8.0,Samantha,"- Is the sex bad, too? ",
62,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- It's the best sex of my life. I think I might really like him.,
63,5.0,8.0,Harry,You want to go to a wedding in the Hamptons in a few weeks? Bitsy Von Muffling's.,
64,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,You're invited to that?,
65,5.0,8.0,Harry,"Oh, yeah, I handled her divorce. ",
66,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,I just never thought of you as a Hamptons type.,
67,5.0,8.0,Harry,"I am the Hamptons, baby. I own a house in Bridge.",
68,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Well, I can't go. I'm not really ready for swimsuit season.",
69,5.0,8.0,Harry,What? You're a fucking knockout.,
70,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- It's you. It's your back. ,
71,5.0,8.0,Harry,- What's wrong with my back?,
72,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,It's very hairy. You're not supposed to be able to grab someone's back.,
73,5.0,8.0,Harry,- This is how I was born. What am I supposed to do about it? ,
74,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- Get it waxed.,
75,5.0,8.0,Harry,"- I'll tell you what. You come with me to the wedding, and I will get my back waxed. ",
76,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- Fine.,
77,5.0,8.0,Harry,"- Come here, you. ",
78,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- Your hands are all greasy.,
79,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"That night, I thought about what it takes to make a relationship work till death do us part. Most singles have more long-term success with friends. So maybe it is a better strategy to marry a friend. However, in the absence of sex, whether that's the arrangement, or just what happens after a few years, what distinguishes this companion from your many other companions? When it comes to saying ""I do"", is a relationship a relationship without the zsa zsa zsu? Or in Samantha's case, how much is a woman due for surviving the zsa zsa zsu?",
80,5.0,8.0,Richard's voicemail,This is Richard. You have 30 seconds.,
81,5.0,8.0,Samantha,"I've been thinking. Our pathetic relationship is as close to marriage as either one of us ever hopes to get. So I feel I deserve some sort of settlement. Like, say, a weekend at your house in the Hamptons. You're not invited. I'll be having a party. You're not invited to that either. It's Samantha. Call me.",
82,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"A couple of weeks later, another couple of exes were working out their summer share.",
83,5.0,8.0,Miranda,- Hi. How you doing?  ,
84,5.0,8.0,Steve,- Hey. Me and Brady were just napping.,

86,5.0,8.0,Steve,I was going to give him one more bottle before I left.,
87,5.0,8.0,Miranda,- I can do it. ,
88,5.0,8.0,Steve,"- I know, but I like it. It used to be all breasts. Not me and him. We got our bottle thing.",
89,5.0,8.0,Miranda,- Did Magda bring those? ,
90,5.0,8.0,Steve,"- No, I did. Nice garden in Queens.",
91,5.0,8.0,Miranda,- Lilacs. ,
92,5.0,8.0,Steve,- Yeah. Good flowers.,
93,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Miranda wasn't sure if it was the smell of the lilacs, the smell of the baby, or the smell of Steve's skin. But that afternoon, Steve went from ex to sex.",
94,5.0,8.0,Miranda,I slept with Steve.,
95,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Miranda admitted they were somewhere between friends and lovers, somewhere between Manhattan and the Hamptons.",
96,5.0,8.0,Carrie,That's why you decided to participate in the charade. You're fleeing.,
97,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"- I'm a fucking fugitive, literally. ",
98,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- Perhaps it was the zsa zsa zsu.,
99,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"No. It was an itch which we shouldn't have scratched, because now we're into a gray area. Not having sex was the only thing holding us together.",
100,5.0,8.0,Carrie,You're fleeing to the right wedding. I think that's the theme.,
101,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"Seriously. You can't have a kid with someone, and get along and have great sex without giving the wrong impression.",
102,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"That being what, that you're happy?",
103,5.0,8.0,Samantha,"Fabulous. Absolutely. Yeah, bring them along. I look forward to seeing you, too. This party is going to be amazing. Strictly A list.",
104,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- Are we still invited?  ,
105,5.0,8.0,Samantha,- Yes. But shitty-pants there is not.,
106,5.0,8.0,Miranda,I have to bring him. I wouldn’t be able to find a sitter.,
107,5.0,8.0,Samantha,He's ruining my lunch. He's not ruining my party. No babies.,
108,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Evidently, there's already a party pooper. Ketchup.",
109,5.0,8.0,Jack,- Carrie? ,
110,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- Yeah. Hi.,
111,5.0,8.0,Jack,- Jack.  ,
112,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"- Berger. I know, I remember.",
113,5.0,8.0,Jack,"What's going on here, are you okay? Do I need to make a tourniquet out of a hotdog bun and a twig?",
114,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"- No, it's just... -",
115,5.0,8.0,Jack,Ketchup.,
116,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Yeah. Thanks. I didn't figure you for a motorcycle guy.,
117,5.0,8.0,Jack,Turns out I'm not. I bought it as a reaction to my breakup.,
118,5.0,8.0,Carrie,It was exactly what I wanted. A Berger with a side of single.,
119,5.0,8.0,Carrie,You look good on it.,
120,5.0,8.0,Jack,"No. I look good next to it. On it, I look like this. I'm not even really hungry. I pulled over because you know, a bug hit my visor, and my hands are still shaking.",
121,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"So you're ""uneasy rider."" Well, if you make it to the Hamptons, my friend is having a party Tomorrow afternoon. It's at Richard's house.",
122,5.0,8.0,Jack,I heard about that. That's quite a place. I pass it on the way to my house. I'm going to get a soda. My throat's kind of dry from all the screaming inside my helmet. It's nice to see you.,
123,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Yeah, you, too, Berger. Maybe I'll see you Tomorrow.",
124,5.0,8.0,Jack,"- Yeah. If you don't, call the Highway Patrol.",
125,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- Yeah.,
126,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Definitely zsa zsa zsu.,
127,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"The next morning, Samantha prepared her borrowed beach house for the big bash.",
128,5.0,8.0,Samantha,I want half the tables set up near the house and the others near the pool. Ladies.,
129,5.0,8.0,Samantha,"- Cassandra, did you bring my tote?  ",
130,5.0,8.0,Girl,"- Shit, where are my Merits?",
131,5.0,8.0,Sam,"Ladies, excuse me. Hi. The wait staff is to change in the guest cottage down near the entrance. Aren't you here to waitress?",
132,5.0,8.0,Girl 2,- We go to restaurants. We don't work in them.  ,
133,5.0,8.0,Girl  ,- Where's Richard?,
134,5.0,8.0,Samantha,Richard? He isn't here. I've got the house this weekend. Excuse me. Where are you going?,
135,5.0,8.0,Girl,Richard told us we could hang by the pool whenever.,
136,5.0,8.0,Sam,You can't pool-hang today. I'm having a party at 3:00.,
137,5.0,8.0,Girls,- We'll be fried by then. - I have no cell reception at all.,
138,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Miranda brought the kid. Don't say anything.,
139,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"I know you didn't want babies, but he's in Ralph Lauren and I stuck a cork up his ass, so it'll be okay.",
140,5.0,8.0,Samantha,This is supposed to be an A-list party.,
141,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Then who's the Double-D list by the pool?,
142,5.0,8.0,Samantha,They won't leave. They say Richard lets them hang out here on weekends. Fucking freeloaders.,
143,5.0,8.0,Carrie,People in glass houses...,
144,5.0,8.0,Samantha,I am not freeloading. I went through a lot with Richard. And people should be rewarded for not getting married as well.,
145,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Frankly, I don't know why you broke up with him. What's a little lying and cheating compared to a pool with a little cabana?",
146,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"Did you say ""no babies,"" or ""no boobies""?",
147,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Lady? And Brady?,
148,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,That is so inappropriate.,
149,5.0,8.0,Harry,- Greetings from Silicone Valley. ,
150,5.0,8.0,Charlotte, People can hear you.,
151,5.0,8.0,Harry,"What, like everyone here can't see those tits are fake? Everyone can see those tits are fake.",
152,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Would you stop saying ""tits""? Why are you wearing that shirt? Tropical shirts are out.",
153,5.0,8.0,Harry,- This is not tropical. It's Tiki.  ,
154,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Well, please Tiki it off.  ",
155,5.0,8.0,Harry,- I thought you'd never ask.,
156,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Oh, my God! Your back! You must've had a bad reaction to the waxing.",
157,5.0,8.0,Harry,"Yeah, I thought it felt a little itchy. Suddenly a little hair isn't looking so bad?",
158,5.0,8.0,Bitsy,"Carrie, woman to woman, the sex is amazing. I've never had a man make me feel this way.",
159,5.0,8.0,Bobby Fine,"Hush, Miss Scarlett, how you do go on. Well, who ordered the Adonis?",
160,5.0,8.0,Stanford,"Bobby, Bitsy, this is my boyfriend, Marcus.",
161,5.0,8.0,Bobby Fine,"For God's sake, man, get yourself to a gym once in a while. Look at that body. It's disgusting! Wow! I could grate cheese on your abs. One large pizza, and hold the salami. Please, put a shirt on before I marry you.",
162,5.0,8.0,Bitsy,No! I haven't touched a carbohydrate in three months. I've got to fit into that dress.,
163,5.0,8.0,Bobby Fine,Please eat something. Would you look at her? She's ltsy-Bitsy.,
164,5.0,8.0,Bitsy,"- Bobby, I see the Talcotts. We've got to say hello. See you all Tomorrow.  ",
165,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- Bye.,
166,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"I swear, and I'm totally serious, I almost fainted when he mimed grated cheese on Marcus.",
167,5.0,8.0,Stanford,It is so obvious that he wanted him.,
168,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Try to keep up. Bobby is straight.,
169,5.0,8.0,Stanford,- Right.  ,
170,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- What is she doing?  ,
171,5.0,8.0,Marcus,Maybe he just makes her laugh.,
172,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,Can't you wait till we sit down to eat? It's so crass.,
173,5.0,8.0,Harry,Question. Is there anything about me today that doesn't bug you?,
174,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,People are trying to eat. You should have your shirt on. And you have sauce on your face.,
175,5.0,8.0,Harry,Now so do you.,
176,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Why did she need to tell me the sex was amazing?,
177,5.0,8.0,Samantha,"Because it is amazing. She's amazed he's able to get hard without another penis in the room. And speaking of dicks, do you think Richard slept with any of those cocoa-butter bitches?",
178,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- No! I'm sure they're just good friends. God! How do I look? ,
179,5.0,8.0,Samantha,- You look great.,
180,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- Jesus! Where's a mirror? ,
181,5.0,8.0,Samantha,- Here.,
182,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Great. All right, put it down. It's okay. Thanks for having a party.",
183,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- How long have you had a house here? ,
184,5.0,8.0,Jack,- Three years.,
185,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Moments later, among the butterflies, I felt butterflies.",
186,5.0,8.0,Jack,- There's a really nice garden ,
187,5.0,8.0,Carrie,". - So, you garden?",
188,5.0,8.0,Jack,"No. I have been known to hoe, but my ex actually planted the garden so we could enjoy fresh summer salads. We didn't quite make it to the summer. So it's more fresh pain than fresh vegetables. Yeah. I can't really go out there.",
189,5.0,8.0,Carrie,I know how you feel. When I broke up with my ex. I couldn't bring myself to go within six blocks of his furniture store.,
190,5.0,8.0,Jack,When did you two break up?,
191,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Last year, for the second time. We broke up the first time the year before that.",
192,5.0,8.0,Jack,You broke up twice. Way to go.,
193,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Yeah, well, we hadn't sufficiently hurt each other enough the first time round. But we definitely took care of business this time. Because this time, he moved in, so we had the merging of the things...",
194,5.0,8.0,Jack,Right.,
195,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"...the dividing of the things, the things that are left behind that you don't want to get back because that seems mean, and you don't want to throw them away because it's all you have left. It gets harder as we get older because we're not dating wildly inappropriate people anymore. You know, there's no ""Glad that's over.""",
196,5.0,8.0,Jack,Right.,
197,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"After every breakup I tell myself I'm not doing this again. It's too hard. I mean, how many of these things can one person survive? You know, they should institute a helmet law for relationships.",
198,5.0,8.0,Jack,- Right. That's excellently put. ,
199,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- Thank you.,
200,5.0,8.0,Jack,"I should get going. It's going to take me six hours to drive the two miles home, so...My jacket.",
201,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- Sorry. Gee. I hope there aren't grass stains. ,
202,5.0,8.0,Jack,"- No. It's old. Okay, bye. ",
203,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- Bye.,
204,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"The man could not get away from me fast enough. Apparently, it's a short road from commisery to misery.",
205,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Are you okay?,
206,5.0,8.0,Samantha,Perfect! Everything's going out right on time.,
207,5.0,8.0,Girl,- There's no Tab in here. ,
208,5.0,8.0,Samantha,- What are you doing in my refrigerator?,
209,5.0,8.0,Girl,- It's Richard's refrigerator. ,
210,5.0,8.0,Samantha,- I stocked it.,
211,5.0,8.0,Girl,Did you see any Rice Krispie treats? Richard usually leaves those around for us.,
212,5.0,8.0,Samantha,"- No, I didn't. And those lemons are for the drinks. Drinks I paid for. ",
213,5.0,8.0,Girl,- Whatever.,
214,5.0,8.0,Samantha,"And I also paid for the food. In fact, The only thing at this party that you two actually paid for are your breasts!",
215,5.0,8.0,Girl,- Jealous?  ,
216,5.0,8.0,Samantha,- Yes. I'm jealous. I'm just dying to look like this.,
217,5.0,8.0,Girl,"Maybe if you did, you'd be out here with Richard. Snap!",
218,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Evidently, people who borrow glass houses shouldn't throw cantaloupes.",
219,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"The next morning, while Stanford and Marcus had Brady, Miranda and I had brunch.",
220,5.0,8.0,Miranda,- How about these muffins? ,
221,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- How about these eggs?,
222,5.0,8.0,Miranda,- How about these napkins?  ,
223,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- How about these plates?,
224,5.0,8.0,Miranda,- How about we marry gay guys? ,
225,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- How about maybe now I won't have a choice?,
226,5.0,8.0,Miranda,- Was it really that bad? ,
227,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"- Bye-bye, Berger.",
228,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"One minute we were laughing, the next minute he had to get away from me so fast, he left skidmarks. Seriously. I can show them to you.",
229,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"Jam, please.",
230,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"I know what I did. I revealed too much, too soon. I was emotionally slutty.",
231,5.0,8.0,Miranda,That's not like you.,
232,5.0,8.0,Carrie,It wasn't me. It was the zsa zsa zsu. It makes me crazy. Bitsy Von Muffling Fine may have the right idea. Maybe we should stop looking for a great relationship and settle for a fine one.,
233,5.0,8.0,Miranda,I'd marry Steve in a second if he were gay. Everything would be so easy.,
234,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"- So, a gay area is better than a gray area? ",
235,5.0,8.0,Miranda,- Yeah. More coffee. You want some? Great coffee.,
236,5.0,8.0,Stanford,Tell me something I don't know. What?,
237,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"You did it, Stany. Great man, great house, great relationship. We've all been looking, and you actually found it.",
238,5.0,8.0,Stanford,Marcus and I haven't had sex since we bought the Cynthia Rowley china.,
239,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Thank God! I am so relieved.,
240,5.0,8.0,Bobby Fine,"Bitsy Von Muffling, the first time I saw you, I fell in love. You walked in wearing that red vintage Dior.",
241,5.0,8.0,Miranda,Pink elephant in the room.,
242,5.0,8.0,Stanford,Do you mind? I am listening to the bride and bride.,
243,5.0,8.0,Bitsy,My dear Bobby Fine…,
244,5.0,8.0,Samantha,"Something tells me Bitsy isn't doing ""Fine.""",
245,5.0,8.0,Harry,And that's the little piece of information she's been Von Muffling.,
246,5.0,8.0,Bitsy,"You are there for me in the morning, and there for me at night, there in the good, there in the bad, there in my thoughts, there in my dreams, but most of all, my darling, you are there in my heart forever.",
247,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Perhaps we were all much too cynical. Perhaps, somehow, despite the odds, Bobby and Bitsy had found something real.",
248,5.0,8.0,Officiant,I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.,
249,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"One more time, for the cheap seats at the back.",
250,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Looks like somebody over here is about to dance.,
251,5.0,8.0,Miranda,I think you may have sold this one a little short.,
252,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Me, too.",
253,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"With a little time and the right astringents, who knows?",
254,5.0,8.0,Harry,"There's nothing on my face, nothing in my teeth. I'm sure you'll hate my moves on the dance floor but that is the risk that every man must take.",
255,5.0,8.0,Carrie,What a beautiful night. It's too bad I blew my only chance at a boyfriend this year.,
256,5.0,8.0,Miranda,You want to hold my boyfriend?,
257,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"I think I'm going to drown my sorrows in another piece of cake. And if anybody asks, I had two, not three.",
258,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"You smell that, Brady? It's lilac. Should we call Daddy and tell him we miss him?",
259,5.0,8.0,Steve's answering machine,"It's me, Steve. I'm not here. Leave a message.",
260,5.0,8.0,Bobby Fine,Do you believe this wedding? Funny where life has taken us. I remember when we went to these things just for the free food.,
261,5.0,8.0,Carrie,I have dinner rolls in my purse.,
262,5.0,8.0,Bobby Fine,"There's my song. And there's my girl, whom I love. In case you had any money riding on it.",
263,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Not a penny.,
264,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"Look out, she's got a piece of fruit, and she's not afraid to throw it.",
265,5.0,8.0,Samantha,Can we not talk about that?,
266,5.0,8.0,Miranda,"Okay. But we'll be the only ones here. Look, I'm just glad Brady wasn't the biggest baby at the party.",
267,5.0,8.0,Samantha,"I guess I went a little crazy, being at Richard's house around his party-crashing pussy posse. What do you call zsa zsa zsu gone bad?",
268,5.0,8.0,Miranda,Zsa zsa eww.,
269,5.0,8.0,Singer,Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world,
270,5.0,8.0,Bobby Fine,"Bitsy, honey, everything was perfect.",
271,5.0,8.0,Bitsy,It was. Except for the dessert. The top layer of the crme brule just wasn't hard enough.,
272,5.0,8.0,Stanford,"Yeah, that's the problem with this wedding. The crme brule isn't hard enough.",
273,5.0,8.0,Singer,"And then one day, he went away, and I thought I would die. But I didn't. And when I didn't, I said to myself, is all that there is to life?",
274,5.0,8.0,Jack,I'm not technically crashing. I was having lunch in town today and for some reason the groom invited me. Shall we?,
275,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Sure.,
276,5.0,8.0,Harry,- What? Now you want me to wax my eyebrows? ,
277,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- I think I may be falling in love with you.,
278,5.0,8.0,Harry,- I've been falling for you since the moment we met. But I never thought...  ,
279,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- What?,
280,5.0,8.0,Harry,"- Come on, you could have any blue-blooded guy here. I'm... ",
281,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- You're wonderful.,
282,5.0,8.0,Harry,- And Jewish. ,
283,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- So?,
284,5.0,8.0,Harry,"- So, where can this go? ",
285,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,- I don't know. Let's find out.,
286,5.0,8.0,Harry,Charlotte. I have to marry a Jew.,
287,5.0,8.0,Charlotte,"She can marry a gay guy, and you can't marry an Episcopalian? What do we do now?",
288,5.0,8.0,Harry,I don't know. Dance?,
289,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"Apparently, Charlotte had a zsa zsa Jew.",
290,5.0,8.0,Jack,- You're awful quiet. ,
291,5.0,8.0,Carrie,- And I intend to stay that way.,
292,5.0,8.0,Jack,No. You were fine. I just wasn't sure if I was up for all that again. Then I thought...,
293,5.0,8.0,Carrie,Then you thought what?,
294,5.0,8.0,Jack,Maybe we should go out on a date before we break up.,
295,5.0,8.0,Carrie,"When it comes to relationships, maybe we're all in glass houses and shouldn't throw stones. Because you can never really know. Some people are settling down. Some people are settling. And some people refuse to settle for anything less...than butterflies.",

202,6.0,2.0,Harry,"Traditionally, they turn you down three times to make sure you're serious.",
203,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Suddenly Charlotte understood.,
204,6.0,2.0,Carrie,They were playing hard to get.,
205,6.0,2.0,Carrie,They were rules rabbis.,

226,6.0,2.0,Jack,A 60-foot raccoon was attacking the village and I had to trap it and kill it and stuff it and everybody's safe now even the little Flanders girl who was stuck in a tree.,
227,6.0,2.0,Jack,But I might have rabies.,
228,6.0,2.0,Jack,What have you been up to?,

244,6.0,2.0,Carrie,I think he's fantastic.,
245,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Aren't we getting a little old to jump to the dump? ,
246,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"What about working on things? Look at Charlotte, she's becoming a Jew.",
247,6.0,2.0,Samantha,I need something that will make a guy come in his pants as soon as he sees me.,
248,6.0,2.0,Sales person,Got it.,
249,6.0,2.0,Carrie,- You talk to sales people like that? ,
250,6.0,2.0,Samantha,- I'm here all the time.,
251,6.0,2.0,Samantha,They love me.,
252,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Is this for a specific gentleman or do you just look for that generally? ,
253,6.0,2.0,Samantha,It's for that hot waiter from Raw.,
254,6.0,2.0,Samantha,"I'm sleeping with him tonight, but he doesn't know it yet.",
255,6.0,2.0,Carrie,I think I have to talk to him.,
256,6.0,2.0,Samantha,- No! ,
257,6.0,2.0,Carrie,- We talk about everything else.,
258,6.0,2.0,Samantha,"Honey, when it comes to sex, spray it, don't say it.",
259,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"- Okay, that was unnecessary.",
260,6.0,2.0,Samantha,- I'm trying to salvage your love life.,
261,6.0,2.0,Samantha,The only words you should be saying in bed are dirty ones.,
262,6.0,2.0,Carrie,I can't do that without alcohol.,
263,6.0,2.0,Samantha,"Then start drinking, because if you want a hotter sex life you're going to have to turn up the heat.",
264,6.0,2.0,Samantha,Starting with ,

267,6.0,2.0,Carrie,- He mostly wears Loafers.,
268,6.0,2.0,Carrie,- Are you sure I can't talk to him about it? ,
269,6.0,2.0,Samantha,"- Honey if the sex isn't great, it doesn't help to say it's not great.",
270,6.0,2.0,Samantha,"That's usually a downer, and by that I mean ",
271,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"Plus, he must know it's not great.",
272,6.0,2.0,Carrie,He can't think this is good.,
273,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"Oh, God.",
274,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Is it possible he thinks this is good? ,
275,6.0,2.0,Sales person,Here we are.,
276,6.0,2.0,Samantha,"As a matter of fact, I'm gonna take this.",
277,6.0,2.0,Carrie,We'll take two.,
278,6.0,2.0,Carrie,And these in a 7.,
279,6.0,2.0,Carrie,That evening Miranda had one of those regrettable discussions that results from the belief that you and your partner should be able to talk through any problem.,
280,6.0,2.0,Miranda,We have been over this before.,
281,6.0,2.0,Miranda,I feel like you are not listening to me.,
282,6.0,2.0,Miranda,I turned the system off for 10 minutes and nothing changed.,
283,6.0,2.0,Miranda,I'm sorry.,
284,6.0,2.0,Miranda,I'm upset.,
285,6.0,2.0,Miranda,I'm just so disappointed.,
286,6.0,2.0,Miranda,I got used to coming home to something.,
287,6.0,2.0,Miranda,Can't you work with me on this? You told me to do that already.,
288,6.0,2.0,Miranda,What is wrong with you? ,
289,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Friday night with Berger.,
290,6.0,2.0,Carrie, I had my sexy lingerie under my cool couture and I was feeling good.,
291,6.0,2.0,Carrie,You look so hot in that shirt.,

293,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"Okay, we're gonna need some drinks.",
294,6.0,2.0,Waitress,"It's happy hour, so frozen margaritas are two-for-one.",
295,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"- All right, okay.",
296,6.0,2.0,Carrie,When in Rome ,
297,6.0,2.0,Jack,- Sure.,
298,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"Since we were 0 for two, I figured two-for-one was a good idea.",
299,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"And after three unreturned phone calls, Charlotte decided to make a house call.",
300,6.0,2.0,Charlotte,"Hello, rabbi.",
301,6.0,2.0,Charlotte,I brought you some kosher wine.,
302,6.0,2.0,Mrs. Minsch,"I'm sorry, but my husband can't see you now.",
303,6.0,2.0,Charlotte,"Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude, but I think he can.",
304,6.0,2.0,Mrs. Minsch,Miss.,
305,6.0,2.0,Charlotte,"What I am 37 years old, I'm reproductively challenged.",
306,6.0,2.0,Charlotte,"I'm in love with a Jewish person, it took me 20 years to find him.",
307,6.0,2.0,Charlotte,I don't have time to play these games.,
308,6.0,2.0,Rabbi,"All right, Charlotte, lesson number one: You have to give it a rest because it's about to be Sabbath, the day of rest.",
309,6.0,2.0,Rabbi,You want to be a Jew? Sit.,

311,6.0,2.0,Rabbi,Learn.,
312,6.0,2.0,Charlotte,That is so sweet.,
313,6.0,2.0,Charlotte,"But actually, I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend I can skip it.",
314,6.0,2.0,Mrs. Minsch,"Come, girls, gather.",
315,6.0,2.0,Charlotte,Sorry.,
316,6.0,2.0,Mrs. Minsch,(Jewish prayer),

318,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"And Samantha was at Raw, ready to get things cooking.",

326,6.0,2.0,Smith,I'm getting slammed.,
327,6.0,2.0,Smith,For some reason the hostess keeps seating everyone in my section.,
328,6.0,2.0,Smith,Be right back.,
329,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Suddenly Samantha realized why the raw food movement was a movement.,
330,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Women weren't there for the cold food they were there for the hot waiter.,
331,6.0,2.0,Miranda,Sorry.,
332,6.0,2.0,Steve,Look who's home.,

336,6.0,2.0,Miranda,Did the TiVo guy come? ,
337,6.0,2.0,Steve,"No, they called and said that they'd have to reschedule for a week from Thursday.",
338,6.0,2.0,Miranda,A week from Thursday? ,
339,6.0,2.0,Steve,"Yeah, but I played around with a few things, and I think it's okay now.",
340,6.0,2.0,Miranda,"- What do you mean, it's working? ",

348,6.0,2.0,Steve,"See you later, champ, all right? ",
349,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"Some things, like a broken TiVo, can be repaired.",
350,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"And others, like a broken heart, are a little more complicated.",
351,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Four hours and four courses of uncooked food later Samantha and her competitors waited it out.,
352,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"Maybe they were less horny, maybe it was all that roughage but one by one, women threw in the napkin.",
353,6.0,2.0,Smith,Can I get you anything else? ,
354,6.0,2.0,Samantha,"No, I'm just enjoying my delicious mushroom tea.",
355,6.0,2.0,Smith,Okay.,
356,6.0,2.0,Smith,- Did you want anything else? ,
357,6.0,2.0,Customer,- You know what? I would like to have some of that Key lime custard.,
358,6.0,2.0,Customer,It sounds too good to pass up.,
359,6.0,2.0,Smith,Okay.,
360,6.0,2.0,Samantha,"Honey, you've put up a good fight but you have no idea who you're dealing with.",
361,6.0,2.0,Samantha,I'm going home with him and you're going home with Key lime custard.,
362,6.0,2.0,Samantha,So what do you say I buy your dinner and we call it a night.,
363,6.0,2.0,Customer,"Oh, okay.",
364,6.0,2.0,Samantha,Check! ,
365,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, I was finally confident I could heat up my sex life because I was a sex columnist.",
366,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"I was resourceful, and I was drunk.",
367,6.0,2.0,Jack,I'm sorry.,
368,6.0,2.0,Carrie,I got a little something for you.,
369,6.0,2.0,Carrie,And you're gonna love it.,
370,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Look at that.,
371,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"Get ready, mister 'cause I got something under here for you.",
372,6.0,2.0,Carrie,And there are shoes.,
373,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Wait till you see me in these.,
374,6.0,2.0,Jack,Are you okay? ,
375,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"Yeah, I'm fine.",
376,6.0,2.0,Carrie,And after a night of raw food Samantha enjoyed an all-nighter of raw sex.,
377,6.0,2.0,Smith,- Can I tell you a secret? ,
378,6.0,2.0,Samantha,- You're 12? ,
379,6.0,2.0,Smith,You didn't have to order all that shit.,
380,6.0,2.0,Smith,I was ready to go home with you last Tuesday.,
381,6.0,2.0,Samantha,"Now you tell me, I ate a fucking cactus.",
382,6.0,2.0,Samantha,- Get back down there and make it up to me.,
383,6.0,2.0,Smith,- Awesome.,
384,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Samantha was still having sex when it dawned on me that Berger and I hadn't.,
385,6.0,2.0,Jack,Hey.,
386,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Hey.,
387,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"We both knew, it was now or never.",
388,6.0,2.0,Carrie,That morning I resigned myself to the idea that I would never again have frozen drinks or hot sex.,
389,6.0,2.0,Jack,"- I suck, this is awful.",
390,6.0,2.0,Carrie,- I know.,
391,6.0,2.0,Jack,I've never been this bad.,
392,6.0,2.0,Jack,"Look, I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I'm way better than this.",
393,6.0,2.0,Jack,I've been told I'm good at this.,
394,6.0,2.0,Jack,I don't know what's happening.,
395,6.0,2.0,Carrie,- We're so good everywhere else.,
396,6.0,2.0,Jack,- Would you look at us in restaurants? ,
397,6.0,2.0,Carrie,- We're the best.,
398,6.0,2.0,Jack,- We're the couple you want to be.,
399,6.0,2.0,Jack,"All right, we gotta make the bed more like a restaurant.",
400,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Are you coming back? ,
401,6.0,2.0,Jack,Yeah.,
402,6.0,2.0,Jack,Grab something that'll help.,
403,6.0,2.0,Jack,Now we're talking.,
404,6.0,2.0,Jack,"What do you have there, a pet? ",
405,6.0,2.0,Carrie,Shoes.,
406,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"Berger, what if we're just not good together in bed? ",
407,6.0,2.0,Jack,"No, don't say that.",
408,6.0,2.0,Jack,"All right, look, I choked.",
409,6.0,2.0,Jack,- We had it all going on.,
410,6.0,2.0,Carrie,- We did.,
411,6.0,2.0,Jack,"I thought it'd be great, and I wanted it to be great and I choked.",
412,6.0,2.0,Jack,I came over the next night and thought it would be better and ,
413,6.0,2.0,Carrie,- I choked.,
414,6.0,2.0,Jack,"- What's up? We should be smoking, not choking.",
415,6.0,2.0,Jack,I think sometimes the rhyme helps.,
416,6.0,2.0,Carrie,I agree.,
417,6.0,2.0,Jack,"Boy, those are some very sexy shoes.",
418,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"- Shall I put them on? - Yeah, couldn't hurt.",
419,6.0,2.0,Jack,"Here, throw some of that over your left shoulder.",
420,6.0,2.0,Jack,"Come on, you want things to get worse? ",
421,6.0,2.0,Jack,"- I was gonna talk to you about it, but ",
422,6.0,2.0,Carrie,"- I wanted to talk to you, but ",
423,6.0,2.0,Jack,Let's make a deal.,
424,6.0,2.0,Jack,"I talk to you, you talk to me.",
425,6.0,2.0,Carrie,We should be able to talk about these things.,
426,6.0,2.0,Jack,- Let's talk about it.,
427,6.0,2.0,Carrie,- We'll talk.,

164,6.0,4.0,Jack,Are we ordering in? ,
165,6.0,4.0,Carrie,He completely shut down.,
166,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Why? Why did I have to get up on my sassy horse and ruin everything? ,
167,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"Yeah, sass will bite you on the ass.",
168,6.0,4.0,Carrie,And the thing that kills me is I love the book.,
169,6.0,4.0,Carrie,I could have gushed about it all night.,
170,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Why did I have to go straight to the negative and just pick at it? ,
171,6.0,4.0,Miranda,Because you're in a relationship.,
172,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"I used to pick at Steve about everything: The way he held his fork, his grammar - his dirty fingernails.",
173,6.0,4.0,Carrie,- Used to? He has a new girlfriend for that now.,
174,6.0,4.0,Miranda,Debbie.,
175,6.0,4.0,Carrie,- Do you think Debbie picks at Steve? ,
176,6.0,4.0,Miranda,- Of course.,
177,6.0,4.0,Miranda,All women pick.,
178,6.0,4.0,Miranda,It's in our DNA.,
179,6.0,4.0,Miranda,It's our little way of showing that we care.,
180,6.0,4.0,Carrie,I think I made it abundantly clear just how much I care.,
181,6.0,4.0,Miranda,You have to work it out with him.,
182,6.0,4.0,Miranda,Berger has single-handedly changed my life.,
183,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"I still haven't heard from the real estate guy, but it's fine.",
184,6.0,4.0,Miranda,He's just not that into me.,

186,6.0,4.0,Miranda,So talk to him about it.,
187,6.0,4.0,Miranda,You two seem like you could laugh your way through anything.,
188,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Yeah, it's that kind of thinking that got me into this in the first place.",
189,6.0,4.0,Carrie,One of the signs that a female gorilla is in love is that she can be seen picking nits off her male companion.,
190,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"And yet, in humans, nit-picking can ruin a perfectly good evening not to mention a relationship.",
191,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Women are known to be more verbal than men.,
192,6.0,4.0,Carrie,But when does criticism that's constructive become destructive? ,
193,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Are there times when the ladies should just shut the fuck up?,

199,6.0,4.0,Pam,I know he'll call eventually.,
200,6.0,4.0,Pam,He's just going through a really hard time right now.,
201,6.0,4.0,Pam,His boss got laid off.,
202,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Later, on her lunch hour, Miranda checked her Blackberry.",
203,6.0,4.0,Carrie,There it was.,
204,6.0,4.0,Carrie,The uncomfortable e-mail Berger had predicted.,
205,6.0,4.0,Pam,"Then, when they get busy, it's like, ""I can't call.",
206,6.0,4.0,Pam,I'm so stressed.,
207,6.0,4.0,Pam,""" But he's gonna call.",
208,6.0,4.0,Pam,- And his kitchen's being rewired.,
209,6.0,4.0,Marcy,- It's all so complicated.,
210,6.0,4.0,Pam,- That's a two-day process.,
211,6.0,4.0,Marcy,- At least.,
212,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation and I hope what I'm gonna say will save you a lot of time and energy.",
213,6.0,4.0,Miranda,He's just not that into you.,
214,6.0,4.0,Miranda,So move on.,
215,6.0,4.0,Miranda,Have a great day.,
216,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Having passed on the gospel to these New York women Miranda could only hope they would spread the word far and wide.,
217,6.0,4.0,Pam,- Bitch.,
218,6.0,4.0,Marcy,- Who the hell asked her? ,
219,6.0,4.0,Pam,Not me.,
220,6.0,4.0,Marcy,- I know you didn't.,
221,6.0,4.0,Pam,- Crazy people in New York.,
222,6.0,4.0,Marcy,- He is so gonna call you.,
223,6.0,4.0,Pam,- I know.,
224,6.0,4.0,Carrie,And as two women's fantasies were being shattered another's were being brought to life.,
225,6.0,4.0,Smith,"Detective Smith, Department of Homicide.",
226,6.0,4.0,Smith,"I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you some questions, ma'am.",
227,6.0,4.0,Samantha,"Why, certainly, Detective.",

232,6.0,4.0,Samantha,"But, you know, Detective one little drink won't kill you.",
233,6.0,4.0,Samantha,- He'll have a martini.,
234,6.0,4.0,Smith,"- No, it's a seltzer.",
235,6.0,4.0,Smith,"Seriously, Samantha, I'm in AA.",
236,6.0,4.0,Carrie,That sobered Samantha right up.,
237,6.0,4.0,Smith,Totally fucked up for eight years in Seattle ,
238,6.0,4.0,Samantha,"You know, I just realized.",
239,6.0,4.0,Samantha,I have a presentation first thing in the morning.,
240,6.0,4.0,Samantha,"So, sorry.",
241,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Jerry had taken the fantasy into dangerous territory.,
242,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Reality.,
243,6.0,4.0,Bartender,- Two martinis.,
244,6.0,4.0,Smith,"- No, dude, I said a seltzer.",
245,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Charlotte was hard at work on her fantasy role.",
246,6.0,4.0,Carrie, Martha Jewart.,
247,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,"The kugel's in the oven, the matzo balls are boiling.",
248,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,It's three hours till Shabbos.,
249,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,We should start braiding the challah.,
250,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Doesn't Shabbos mean ""day of rest,"" i.e. ordering in? ",
251,6.0,4.0,Miranda,We're wearing aprons.,
252,6.0,4.0,Miranda,Do you own aprons? ,
253,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,- The challah! ,
254,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"- Okay, you don't have to holler.",
255,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,"Miranda, like this.",
256,6.0,4.0,Miranda,I don't know what I'm doing.,
257,6.0,4.0,Miranda,Why did you call me over here? ,
258,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Because I didn't want to spend the entire week saying, ""Guess you had to be there.""",
259,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,Did Harry's friend ever call you? ,
260,6.0,4.0,Miranda,Yes.,
261,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"As a matter of fact, I'm seeing him tonight.",
262,6.0,4.0,Miranda,You think I can get away with this outfit? ,
263,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Definitely, the apron softens you.",
264,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,"Can you read me what's next, after it's braided? ",
265,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"With her high school boyfriend, Charlotte doodled.",
266,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"With Harry, she Jew-dled.",
267,6.0,4.0,Miranda,I think it calls for two cups of Mrs. Harry York-Goldenblatt.,
268,6.0,4.0,Miranda,Did I miss something? Did you get married while I was at work?,
269,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,"No, but that's where we're headed.",
270,6.0,4.0,Carrie,You forgot Charlotte Yorkenblatt.,
271,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,"Actually, I've been making some calls and I was wondering how you both felt about November.",
272,6.0,4.0,Miranda,November? For what? ,
273,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,For our wedding.,
274,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,Most of the synagogues are booked through the fall.,
275,6.0,4.0,Carrie,- November works for me.,
276,6.0,4.0,Miranda,- Has Harry even proposed yet? ,
277,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,"No, but he will.",
278,6.0,4.0,Miranda,Aren't you counting your matzo balls before they rise? ,
279,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Miranda, zip the lip.",
280,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,We have an understanding about our future.,
281,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,We don't have to talk about it all the time.,
282,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,It's b'shert.,
283,6.0,4.0,Miranda,- I don't know what that means.,
284,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,- It's meant to be.,
285,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,I would never have gone through all this trouble if I didn't know for sure that we were getting married.,
286,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"I'm sorry, I just don't want to see you get hurt again.",
287,6.0,4.0,Carrie,And ever since her reality check with Jerry Samantha had no interest in seeing him again.,
288,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"However, when a certain government official called she was more than happy to take a meeting.",
289,6.0,4.0,Samantha,"Secret Service Agent Smith, if you're here who's protecting the President? ",
290,6.0,4.0,Smith,"You know, I changed my mind.",
291,6.0,4.0,Smith,I thought of something even hotter for us to play.,
292,6.0,4.0,Samantha,Hotter than Secret Service sluts? ,
293,6.0,4.0,Smith,"I'm me, you're you.",
294,6.0,4.0,Smith,Go.,
295,6.0,4.0,Smith,"You know, when I told you the other night I was in AA, you bolted.",
296,6.0,4.0,Smith,What's up with that? ,
297,6.0,4.0,Samantha,"It is Jerry, isn't it? ",
298,6.0,4.0,Samantha,I'm afraid we want different things.,
299,6.0,4.0,Samantha,You want to tell me all about you and I don't want you to tell me all about you.,
300,6.0,4.0,Samantha,It spoils the fantasy.,
301,6.0,4.0,Smith,- That's harsh.,
302,6.0,4.0,Samantha,"- Yeah, I am harsh.",
303,6.0,4.0,Samantha,"I'm also demanding, stubborn, self-sufficient, and always right.",
304,6.0,4.0,Samantha,"In bed, at the office, and everywhere else.",
305,6.0,4.0,Smith,- I already knew that.,
306,6.0,4.0,Samantha,- And that's just a little bit about me.,
307,6.0,4.0,Smith,"All right, cool.",
308,6.0,4.0,Smith,Let me tell you one little thing about me.,
309,6.0,4.0,Samantha,"- See, this is exactly ",
310,6.0,4.0,Smith,- At least let me tell you my last name.,
311,6.0,4.0,Smith,It's Jerrod.,
312,6.0,4.0,Samantha,Your parents named you Jerry Jerrod? ,
313,6.0,4.0,Samantha,- No wonder you drank.,
314,6.0,4.0,Smith,- Right.,
315,6.0,4.0,Carrie,There would still be accountants and undercover agents in their future.,
316,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"But that night, Samantha and Jerry got off on playing themselves.",
317,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, I was looking forward to putting the scrunchy moment behind us.",
318,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, it was staring us in the face.",
319,6.0,4.0,Jack,"Okay, I'm sorry to have to do this but I do believe we are in the presence of a scrunchy.",
320,6.0,4.0,Jack,"I also do believe, and correct me if I'm wrong that we are in New York City proper.",
321,6.0,4.0,Jack,This woman does not appear to be washing her face.,
322,6.0,4.0,Jack,"She appears to be standing in line at a hip, downtown restaurant.",
323,6.0,4.0,Jack,So it kind of kills your New York woman theory.,
324,6.0,4.0,Jack,"Tough break, Bradshaw.",
325,6.0,4.0,Carrie,- She's not from New York.,
326,6.0,4.0,Jack,- What? Doesn't matter.,
327,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Doesn't matter.,
328,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Did they say how long the wait was gonna be? ,
329,6.0,4.0,Jack,Excuse me.,
330,6.0,4.0,Jack,"Hi, I'm sorry to bother you.",
331,6.0,4.0,Jack,We're just wondering what part of New York you live in.,
332,6.0,4.0,Restaurant Patron,"Me? I am from Macon, Georgia.",
333,6.0,4.0,Restaurant Patron,"But thanks, you made my whole day.",
334,6.0,4.0,Restaurant Patron,"Honey, did you hear that? These people think I live in New York.",
335,6.0,4.0,Restaurant Patron,I'm so hungry.,
336,6.0,4.0,Restaurant Patron,When are they gonna let us sit down? ,
337,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Downtown, over curried lamb and chutney Miranda found herself pleasantly surprised by Charlotte's matchmaking skills.",
338,6.0,4.0,Paul,That was one spicy biryani! ,
339,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"I know, I've lost all feeling in my tongue.",
340,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"Listen, I know a great place around the corner if you wanna get coffee.",
341,6.0,4.0,Paul,"I wish I could, but I really should call it a night.",
342,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"It's fine, I understand.",
343,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"You're just not that into me, and it's okay.",
344,6.0,4.0,Miranda,I get it.,
345,6.0,4.0,Paul,"No, I like you.",
346,6.0,4.0,Paul,I just really have to go.,
347,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"- Paul, come on, you can stop lying.",
348,6.0,4.0,Paul,- I am not lying.,
349,6.0,4.0,Miranda,"Come on, be a man.",
350,6.0,4.0,Miranda,Tell the truth.,
351,6.0,4.0,Paul,I have diarrhea.,
352,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Apparently there is one rare exception to Berger's rule and it often involves curry.,
353,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"After dinner, Berger ate banana cream pie and I ate my words.",
354,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Another thing I loved was the way you used the sister's phone calls as little landposts.,
355,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"I mean, landmarks or mileposts.",
356,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Anyway I just loved how those sort of punctuated the story.,
357,6.0,4.0,Carrie,It was just a really nice touch.,
358,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Oh, my God, the introduction Brilliant! You're instantly on this guy's side, even though he's a complete mess.",
359,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"You know, you really just nailed him.",
360,6.0,4.0,Carrie,While I was working overtime Charlotte's work was finally coming to an end.,
361,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,"Harry, you can come on in now.",
362,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,Sorry it's so late.,
363,6.0,4.0,Harry ,What's all this? ,
364,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,"Since it's our first Shabbos together, I wanted to make it a little special.",
365,6.0,4.0,Harry ,A little? ,
366,6.0,4.0,Harry ,This is phenomenal.,
367,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,I just need to get the candles and then we can say the bracha.,
368,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,Come on.,
369,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,"Honey, please turn that off.",
370,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,We're about to eat.,
371,6.0,4.0,Harry ,It smells incredible.,
372,6.0,4.0,Harry ,And you made brisket.,
373,6.0,4.0,Harry ,I cannot believe you made brisket.,
374,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,- Good Shabbos.,
375,6.0,4.0,Harry ,"- Good Shabbos, sweetie.",
376,6.0,4.0,Harry ,I cannot believe you made all this.,
377,6.0,4.0,Harry ,- What did I do to deserve you? ,
378,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,- I feel the same way.,
379,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,I've been thinking about blessings and you are such a blessing to me.,
380,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,What are you ,
381,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,- Why is the TV on? ,
382,6.0,4.0,Harry ,- It's on mute.,
383,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,Mute? We're having Shabbos dinner.,
384,6.0,4.0,Harry ,"It's a big game, honey.",
385,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,Turn it off.,
386,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,I want you to turn it off right this minute.,
387,6.0,4.0,Harry ,- But it's ,
388,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,- Off now.,
389,6.0,4.0,Harry ,Let me just watch this one pitch.,
390,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,I gave up Christ for you and you can't give up the Mets? ,
391,6.0,4.0,Harry ,It's gonna be a long life if you keep that up.,
392,6.0,4.0,Harry ,"""I gave up Christ for you, take out the trash.",
393,6.0,4.0,Harry ,"""I gave up Christ for you, pick up your socks.""",
394,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,Do you have any idea how hard I worked to prepare this meal for you? ,
395,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,I went to Zabar's every day this week I had to make 30 matzo balls just to get four that were the right size and shape.,
396,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,Not to mention the months of studying and cramming like a maniac to convert to Judaism.,
397,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,And what have you done for me? Set the date.,
398,6.0,4.0,Harry ,What are you talking about? ,
399,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,You said you couldn't marry me unless I was Jewish and now I'm Jewish.,
400,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,Set the date! ,
401,6.0,4.0,Harry ,You're acting crazy! Do you hear yourself? ,
402,6.0,4.0,Charlotte,Do you know how lucky you are to have me? Do you know how we look? Do you know what people out there think when they see us together? Do you? ,
403,6.0,4.0,Harry ,"Yeah, I know what people are thinking.",
404,6.0,4.0,Harry ,I just didn't think you were one of them.,
405,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Finally it was Charlotte who was on mute.,
406,6.0,4.0,Harry ,I don't need this.,
407,6.0,4.0,Harry ,I'm leaving.,
408,6.0,4.0,Harry ,To think I bought a ring.,
409,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"The Mets won that night, 5 to 4.",
410,6.0,4.0,Carrie,But Charlotte lost everything that mattered to her.,
411,6.0,4.0,Carrie,I just remembered another hilarious part.,
412,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"And later, on the corner of 73rd and mea culpa ",
413,6.0,4.0,Carrie,You know the scene where the dishwasher guy is spooning up the Rice Chex and he's putting them back in the box? ,
414,6.0,4.0,Carrie,It's perfection.,
415,6.0,4.0,Carrie,How did you come up with that? ,
416,6.0,4.0,Jack,- It's so lame.,
417,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"- No, it was not.",
418,6.0,4.0,Carrie,It was hysterical.,
419,6.0,4.0,Jack,I'm not talking about the book.,
420,6.0,4.0,Jack,I'm talking about what you're doing right now.,
421,6.0,4.0,Carrie,I just wanted you to know how much I loved your book because I did.,
422,6.0,4.0,Carrie,And I'm sorry I muddied it up with the whole scrunchy thing.,
423,6.0,4.0,Jack,It's not that big a deal.,
424,6.0,4.0,Jack,I think I'm gonna call it a night.,
425,6.0,4.0,Jack,I gotta get an early start tomorrow.,
426,6.0,4.0,Carrie,- Are you kidding? ,
427,6.0,4.0,Jack,- No.,
428,6.0,4.0,Jack,Thanks for dinner.,
429,6.0,4.0,Jack,I'll call you tomorrow.,
430,6.0,4.0,Carrie,And then there are times when a New York woman should not shut the fuck up.,
431,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Hey. Berger. Berger. You can't just pull that line on me and walk away.,
432,6.0,4.0,Jack,This time it's true.,
433,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"You're obviously still pissed, and I'm sorry but you can't just shut down like this.",
434,6.0,4.0,Carrie,We have to be able to say what's on our minds.,
435,6.0,4.0,Carrie,If you thought that I had made some kind of mistake I would want you to tell me.,
436,6.0,4.0,Jack,Nice hat. Carrie,
437,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"It's fabulous, and you said that to hurt my feelings.",

442,6.0,4.0,Jack,"I'm sorry, all right? ",
443,6.0,4.0,Jack,What was I supposed to do with that scrunchy comment?,
444,6.0,4.0,Jack,Was I supposed to hop in my time machine and fix my entire book? ,
445,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"I don't know what your problem is, but it has nothing to do with a scrunchy.",
446,6.0,4.0,Jack,"Yeah, it's about the fact that my book is a big, fat, fucking failure.",
447,6.0,4.0,Carrie,- Wait.,
448,6.0,4.0,Carrie,What? ,
449,6.0,4.0,Jack,"- It's just, I already feel like shit.",
450,6.0,4.0,Jack,"You trying to pump me up all night, not helping.",
451,6.0,4.0,Jack,I'm sure this is all very sexy.,
452,6.0,4.0,Jack,You probably never really ,
453,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Stop.,
454,6.0,4.0,Carrie,I want to say something and I want you to listen.,
455,6.0,4.0,Carrie,You're a beautiful writer and I loved your book.,

458,6.0,4.0,Carrie,And I'm not gonna let you make a joke right now.,
459,6.0,4.0,Jack,Then I got nothing.,
460,6.0,4.0,Carrie,Come on.,
461,6.0,4.0,Carrie,"Saying ""I love you"" is easy.",
462,6.0,4.0,Carrie,What comes next is a little scrunchier.,

145,6.0,6.0,Carrie,can you ask the chef if the marinade for the tuna has parsley in it?,

153,6.0,6.0,Jack,Why don't you just say that?,
154,6.0,6.0,Carrie,"Because when I say that, parsley somehow,",
155,6.0,6.0,Carrie,magically appears on the plate and I feel bad,
156,6.0,6.0,Carrie,because I have to send it back.,
157,6.0,6.0,Jack,You didn't even order something that usually comes with parsley.,

186,6.0,6.0,Carrie,"Wait, you want to take the break starting now?",
187,6.0,6.0,Carrie,I thought you would at least come up and we need to talk.,
188,6.0,6.0,Jack,I... I don't need to talk.,
189,6.0,6.0,Jack,Ok? I need some time to think.,
190,6.0,6.0,Carrie,"Well, how much time?",
191,6.0,6.0,Jack,About a week?,

203,6.0,6.0,Carrie,"Oh, come on it's a hop, skip and a week from a break up.",
204,6.0,6.0,Charlotte,Or it's the thing that saves you from saying the things that you wish you could take back,
205,6.0,6.0,Charlotte,but you can't!,
206,6.0,6.0,Charlotte,"If Harry and I had taken a break, then maybe I wouldn't be out on blind dates again.",
207,6.0,6.0,Carrie,"Hey, remember when a break was a good thing?",

224,6.0,6.0,Samantha,Make fun but a bump in the road is never good.,
225,6.0,6.0,Samantha,And you shouldn't bother staying around to find out how not good.,
226,6.0,6.0,Carrie,"Well, it's not all frowns.",
227,6.0,6.0,Carrie,Berger and I have a lot of good stuff too. It's complicated.,
228,6.0,6.0,Carrie,Complicated by the fact that the man had to go all the way to Long Island to think this through.,
229,6.0,6.0,Samantha,Maybe you can send him a postcard!,
230,6.0,6.0,Miranda,That is the most blatant agenda pushing I have ever seen.,

239,6.0,6.0,Samantha,Here's an idea.,
240,6.0,6.0,Samantha,Why don't you use this time to think about what you want.,

242,6.0,6.0,Carrie,The next day I got to thinking about trials and trial separations.,

130,6.0,7.0,Miranda,How about the day your friend discovered all her clothes are covered in spit-up? ,

161,6.0,7.0,Carrie,Hallelujah! ,
162,6.0,7.0,Samantha,"Okay, let's go to Bed.",

202,6.0,7.0,Samantha,"I'm not dating him, I'm fucking him.",
203,6.0,7.0,Samantha,Now I'm looking for someone else to fuck.,

41,6.0,8.0,Instructor,Take your hands off and reach for me.,
42,6.0,8.0,Instructor,This time you got it.,
43,6.0,8.0,Instructor,Let go.,
44,6.0,8.0,Instructor,Let go.,
45,6.0,8.0,Carrie,No.,
46,6.0,8.0,Carrie,That day I didn't get caught but Samantha's zipper did.,
47,6.0,8.0,Carrie,This is one of the frustrating things about living alone.,
48,6.0,8.0,Carrie,There's not always somebody around to rip your clothes off.,
49,6.0,8.0,Samantha,"Hey, Smith, wanna come over and do me? ",
50,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"What she meant was ""undo me.""",
51,6.0,8.0,Carrie,But two birds with one stone.,
52,6.0,8.0,Carrie,And in Central Park a photographer attempted to catch two lovebirds sitting on a stone.,
53,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Honey, a little less teeth.",
54,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,Just relax your lips.,
55,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"No, now you're squinting.",
56,6.0,8.0,Carrie,A lesser man might have told Charlotte to take a flying leap but Harry loved her too much.,
57,6.0,8.0,Harry ,- I thought the point was to look natural.,
58,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,- That's what I'm trying to get you to do.,
59,6.0,8.0,Harry ,"One might ask, how natural is it to be sitting in Central Park in a suit? ",
60,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,I read the wedding section religiously and I know what they're looking for.,
61,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,Not all pictures are selected.,
62,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,And I really want there to be a York-Goldenblatt announcement of our wedding in the Sunday Times.,
63,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"So, please, just a little less teeth.",
64,6.0,8.0,Harry ,"Charlotte York, I cannot wait to marry you.",
65,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,- That's perfect.,
66,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,That's it.,
67,6.0,8.0,Harry ,- I was having a moment.,
68,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,Lipstick! ,
69,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,Wait! ,
70,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"No, sorry, no kissing pictures.",
71,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,It's tacky.,
72,6.0,8.0,Carrie,And speaking of tacky ,
73,6.0,8.0,Steve,"Cute, huh?",
74,6.0,8.0,Steve,Debbie bought it for him over at the Sixth Avenue flea market.,
75,6.0,8.0,Miranda,Did you wash it first? ,
76,6.0,8.0,Steve,She also got something for you.,
77,6.0,8.0,Steve,It's aromatherapy.,
78,6.0,8.0,Steve,"You know, I was thinking, maybe we should figure out a time for the two of you to meet.",
79,6.0,8.0,Miranda,What? Why? ,
80,6.0,8.0,Steve,She's around Brady.,
81,6.0,8.0,Steve,I know you're not comfortable with that.,
82,6.0,8.0,Miranda,I'm completely comfortable.,
83,6.0,8.0,Miranda,I don't need to meet her.,
84,6.0,8.0,Miranda,I trust you.,
85,6.0,8.0,Miranda,She bought me a fucking candle.,
86,6.0,8.0,Miranda,"And it was an aromatherapy candle, for serenity and calm.",
87,6.0,8.0,Miranda,I was much more serene and calm before the fucking candle.,
88,6.0,8.0,Samantha,Women with candles replace women with cats as the new sad thing.,
89,6.0,8.0,Miranda,And get this: He thinks I should meet her.,
90,6.0,8.0,Miranda,I sense that he wants us to become friends.,
91,6.0,8.0,Carrie,Forget it.,
92,6.0,8.0,Carrie,You do not need to become friends with the new girlfriend.,
93,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"It's unnatural, uncomfortable, insincere and rife with ulterior motive.",
94,6.0,8.0,Miranda,- Has this happened to you? ,
95,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"- No, I'm just being supportive.",
96,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,- But there is a baby involved.,
97,6.0,8.0,Miranda,- Exactly.,
98,6.0,8.0,Miranda,"She's using Brady to get to me, and I am not falling for it.",
99,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"Speaking of falling, I tried the trapeze yesterday for that piece that I'm writing.",
100,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,I could never! ,
101,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,I have the most terrible fear of heights.,
102,6.0,8.0,Carrie,I do not.,
103,6.0,8.0,Carrie,You've seen my shoes.,
104,6.0,8.0,Miranda,So did you fly through the air with the greatest of ease? ,
105,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"At first, but then I couldn't do a catch.",
106,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"I had to let go and reach for the guy, who was very cute, and I still couldn't do it.",
107,6.0,8.0,Samantha,You are insane for getting into a harness without even a hope of an orgasm.,
108,6.0,8.0,Harry ,"- Hello, ladies.",
109,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"- Hi, honey.",
110,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"- Hey, Harry.",
111,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"- Hi, Howie.",
112,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Everyone, this is Harry's best friend Howie Halberstein, in from Portland.",
113,6.0,8.0,Harry ,We're not crashing.,
114,6.0,8.0,Harry ,I'm just here to drop off the photo proofs and the seating chart.,
115,6.0,8.0,Harry ,"We're gonna have a quick bite to eat, then I'm taking the place cards to the calligrapher.",
116,6.0,8.0,Howie Halberstein,"After that, we're gonna go around the corner and try to find our balls.",
117,6.0,8.0,Howie Halberstein,"Yes, Harry knows how to show a guy a good time.",
118,6.0,8.0,Harry ,"Howie, this is Samantha and Miranda and Carrie.",
119,6.0,8.0,Howie Halberstein,- Hi.,
120,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"- Hi, how are you? ",
121,6.0,8.0,Howie Halberstein,- Good.,
122,6.0,8.0,Carrie,- Good.,
123,6.0,8.0,Harry ,Good guy.,
124,6.0,8.0,Harry ,"You two, I see it happening.",
125,6.0,8.0,Harry ,"So, Carrie, I was thinking maybe you might show Howie around a little later.",
126,6.0,8.0,Howie Halberstein,Unless Harry needs me to ice a cake or something.,
127,6.0,8.0,Carrie,I'm kind of busy because I have to do a flying trapeze thing.,
128,6.0,8.0,Howie,That is so weird.,
129,6.0,8.0,Howie,"I have a lion-taming thing tomorrow, so that's out for me.",
130,6.0,8.0,Howie,"But, you know, if you change your mind, I'll give you my business card.",
131,6.0,8.0,Howie,- There you go.,
132,6.0,8.0,Carrie,- Thank you.,
133,6.0,8.0,Howie,All my lines are on there.,
134,6.0,8.0,Howie,"Call me, I'll be waiting by the phone.",
135,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,- What's wrong with you? ,
136,6.0,8.0,Miranda,- He was funny and cute.,
137,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"Yeah, and in town for a week.",
138,6.0,8.0,Carrie,What's the point? ,
139,6.0,8.0,Samantha,That is the point.,
140,6.0,8.0,Samantha,"It's the best possible scenario, because you know he's leaving.",
141,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"But it's like whatever happens, there's an expiration date.",
142,6.0,8.0,Carrie,- It's expiration dating.,
143,6.0,8.0,Samantha,- It isn't dating.,
144,6.0,8.0,Samantha,It's sex.,
145,6.0,8.0,Samantha,It's fun.,
146,6.0,8.0,Samantha,It's a fling.,
147,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"Please, I'm too old for a fling.",
148,6.0,8.0,Carrie,I can barely do a swing.,
149,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"If you'll excuse me, I have to go home so I can write about the fact that I couldn't do a catch.",
150,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,- He is a catch.,
151,6.0,8.0,Samantha,- You should do him.,
152,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"When you're young, your whole life is about the pursuit of fun.",
153,6.0,8.0,Carrie,Then you grow up and learn to be cautious.,
154,6.0,8.0,Carrie,You could break a bone or a heart.,
155,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"You look before you leap, and sometimes you don't leap at all because there's not always someone there to catch you.",
156,6.0,8.0,Carrie,And in life there's no safety net.,
157,6.0,8.0,Carrie,When did it stop being fun and start being scary? ,
158,6.0,8.0,Carrie,I decided it was time to leave fear behind and have some fun.,
159,6.0,8.0,Instructor,"Okay, legs up.",
160,6.0,8.0,Instructor,- That's good.,
161,6.0,8.0,Instructor,Let go and reach for me.,
162,6.0,8.0,Carrie,- I can't.,
163,6.0,8.0,Instructor,"All right, this time.",
164,6.0,8.0,Instructor,Let go.,
165,6.0,8.0,Carrie,I can't.,
166,6.0,8.0,Anthony,Don't tell me you can't.,
167,6.0,8.0,Anthony,I want nothing but lilies on the chuppah.,
168,6.0,8.0,Anthony,The theme is Yentl Chic.,
169,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,Don't forget the candles.,
170,6.0,8.0,Anthony,This isn't the first wedding I've planned.,
171,6.0,8.0,Anthony,"Jesus Christ, you're worse than me! ",
172,6.0,8.0,Anthony,"We want candles, candles, candles.",
173,6.0,8.0,Anthony,"And I don't want short, stubby, broken-up dick candles.",

182,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,The hora.,
183,6.0,8.0,Anthony,Be careful.,
184,6.0,8.0,Anthony,God forbid you fall off the chair.,
185,6.0,8.0,Anthony,"Oh, the horror! The horror! ",
186,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,- Maybe we won't do the chair thing.,
187,6.0,8.0,Anthony,- You have to.,
188,6.0,8.0,Anthony,That's the big finish.,
189,6.0,8.0,Anthony,"Remember, when you're up there, pretend you're having a good time hang on for dear life, and for fuck's sake keep your legs together.",
190,6.0,8.0,Anthony,Nobody wants to see the bride's beaver.,
191,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,Don't say that in front of my dress.,
192,6.0,8.0,Anthony,Hello.,
193,6.0,8.0,Anthony,York residence.,
194,6.0,8.0,Anthony,"Yes, we have a minute.",
195,6.0,8.0,Anthony,It's The New York Times fact checker.,
196,6.0,8.0,Anthony,"Yes, Goldenblatt has two ""T""s.",
197,6.0,8.0,Anthony,Sure.,
198,6.0,8.0,Anthony,Fax it over! ,
199,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"We're in, we're in! ",
200,6.0,8.0,Anthony,This calls for a hora! Hey! ,
201,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Oh, my God! What're you doing here? Don't look at me! ",
202,6.0,8.0,Anthony,"Jesus Christ, Char, my ear.",
203,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,You're not supposed to see me in my dress.,
204,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"This is bad luck, very bad luck! Close your eyes.",
205,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Keep them closed! Oh, no, this is so bad.",
206,6.0,8.0,Harry ,Are all brides like that? ,
207,6.0,8.0,Anthony,That's nothing.,
208,6.0,8.0,Anthony,I once had a girl in Long Island give herself a stroke.,
209,6.0,8.0,Anthony,"She pulled it together for the big day, though.",
210,6.0,8.0,Smith,Hopefully I'll get cell reception down in Mexico.,
211,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"Samantha, a fan of expiration dating was about to enjoy one of the benefits of dating an actor.",
212,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"Location, location, location.",
213,6.0,8.0,Smith,It's gonna be cool working with Gus Van Sant.,
214,6.0,8.0,Smith,Here.,
215,6.0,8.0,Smith,Let me.,
216,6.0,8.0,Smith,I can't believe we don't get to spend my last night together.,

224,6.0,8.0,Smith,It's a long time.,
225,6.0,8.0,Samantha,Would you get out of here already? I'm late as it is.,
226,6.0,8.0,Smith,"Yeah, yeah.",
227,6.0,8.0,Samantha,"And listen, when you're on location don't do anything I wouldn't do.",
228,6.0,8.0,Smith,- What does that rule out? ,

266,6.0,8.0,Steve,"- Bye, Magda.",
267,6.0,8.0,Miranda,There's a lot of dust down there.,
268,6.0,8.0,Miranda,You really should vacuum under ,
269,6.0,8.0,Carrie,That night we all gathered at Charlotte's casual rehearsal dinner.,
270,6.0,8.0,Carrie,You're like a lint tray.,
271,6.0,8.0,Carrie,What's happening back here? ,
272,6.0,8.0,Miranda,That Debbie is crazy.,
273,6.0,8.0,Miranda,She came to my apartment with Steve and totally ambushed me.,

281,6.0,8.0,Carrie,Maybe you should just meet her and get it over with.,
282,6.0,8.0,Miranda,I don't want to meet her.,
283,6.0,8.0,Miranda,"If I meet her, she's real, and that means Steve has an actual girlfriend.",
284,6.0,8.0,Carrie,Apparently I wasn't the only one who had trouble letting go.,

286,6.0,8.0,Carrie,What's happening there? ,

290,6.0,8.0,Samantha,I just saw your fling go into the bathroom.,
291,6.0,8.0,Samantha,It's like shooting fish in a barrel.,
292,6.0,8.0,Carrie,Still no.,
293,6.0,8.0,Samantha,It's just casual sex.,
294,6.0,8.0,Carrie,Nothing's casual anymore.,
295,6.0,8.0,Carrie,Not even when it says so on the invitation.,
296,6.0,8.0,Miranda,Just go in there and see what happens.,
297,6.0,8.0,Miranda,"Worst comes to worst, you could always hide under the bed.",
298,6.0,8.0,Carrie,I decided they were right.,
299,6.0,8.0,Carrie,It was time to get back in the swing of things.,
300,6.0,8.0,Howie,- Good to see you.,

308,6.0,8.0,Howie,"No, I understand, you're busy.",
309,6.0,8.0,Howie,That time of year.,
310,6.0,8.0,Howie,Final exams for Clown College or something.,
311,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"What would that entail, you think? ",
312,6.0,8.0,Howie,"The seating arrangements in the little car, walking in the floppy shoes ",
313,6.0,8.0,Carrie,Squirting flower and nose application.,
314,6.0,8.0,Howie,"continual pieing, the cloud-kissing ",
315,6.0,8.0,Carrie,Maybe I would have a fling.,
316,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"After all, how bad could it be? ",
317,6.0,8.0,Carrie,That night Howie and I had sex like we were teenagers again.,
318,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"Meaning he had no idea what he was doing, and I didn't say anything.",
319,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Samantha was banging around as well.",
320,6.0,8.0,Answering Machine,You have one new message.,
321,6.0,8.0,Smith,"Hey, I'm here.",
322,6.0,8.0,Smith,It's pretty cool.,
323,6.0,8.0,Smith,You miss me yet? ,
324,6.0,8.0,Carrie,That's the thing about getting used to a man.,
325,6.0,8.0,Carrie,There's always a catch.,
326,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,It's here! ,
327,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"Not just her wedding day, but The New York Times.",
328,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"Oh, my God! ",
329,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,I have a moustache.,
330,6.0,8.0,Harry ,It's an ink stain.,
331,6.0,8.0,Harry ,But look at me.,
332,6.0,8.0,Harry ,"Now, that is a terrific smile.",
333,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,This is a nightmare! ,
334,6.0,8.0,Harry ,It's probably just our paper.,
335,6.0,8.0,Harry ,"Anyway, who cares? ",
336,6.0,8.0,Harry ,We're getting married today! ,
337,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,I look like Hitler! ,

342,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,"In your wedding section, does it look like I have a moustache? ",

344,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"As I feared, my fling had become a pain in the neck.",
345,6.0,8.0,Harry ,You do not look like Hitler.,
346,6.0,8.0,Harry ,"Frito Bandito, maybe.",
347,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,The bad luck is starting already.,
348,6.0,8.0,Carrie,Yeah.,
349,6.0,8.0,Carrie,There's a little something but maybe it's just my paper.,
350,6.0,8.0,Carrie,And your paper.,
351,6.0,8.0,Charlotte,I have to go.,
352,6.0,8.0,Carrie,"Clearly, Charlotte was bent out of shape, and so was I.",
353,6.0,8.0,Stanford,"Come on, granny.",
354,6.0,8.0,Stanford,I'll take you to the Early Bird Special.,

174,6.0,9.0,Miranda,Look at that dirty little rugrat.,
175,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,That's just chocolate.,
176,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,"All children are beautiful, but not as beautiful as Brady.",
177,6.0,9.0,Miranda,That's true.,
178,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Hey, so how goes the big matrimonial move-in? ",
179,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,Good.,
180,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,Harry's moved most of his stuff in.,
181,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,It's going well.,
182,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,"And I'm just trying to learn to compromise, because sometimes I can be a little rigid.",
183,6.0,9.0,Miranda,That's not true.,
184,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,"There's just one thing and it's small, but it really grosses me out.",
185,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,We have a teabag situation.,
186,6.0,9.0,Samantha,I understand.,
187,6.0,9.0,Samantha,Just breathe through your nose.,
188,6.0,9.0,Samantha,- When you're sucking his balls.,
189,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- What? No! I was talking about Harry leaves his old teabags around the house.,
190,6.0,9.0,Samantha,"I thought you meant ""tea bagging,"" when you hold a guy's balls in your mouth.",
191,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"Why is it called Oh, I get it! Because they hang, and the dipping.",
192,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Oh, great.",
193,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Now I've lost my shoes and my appetite.,
194,6.0,9.0,Samantha,This is very good.,
195,6.0,9.0,Harry ,"You now what I love about living with you, besides those nutty soaps in the bathroom? ",
196,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- What? ,
197,6.0,9.0,Harry ,- Living with you.,
198,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,Honey - I need to talk to you.,
199,6.0,9.0,Harry ,"- What's up, baby? ",
200,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,"I really don't mean to be a nag, but it's just, well It's this.",
201,6.0,9.0,Harry ,- Tea? ,
202,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,"- No, teabags.",
203,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,"You leave them all over the house, and they stain.",
204,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,Maybe you could just try to be a little more careful.,
205,6.0,9.0,Harry ,"- Damn! I though I was doing so well, too.",
206,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- What do you mean? ,
207,6.0,9.0,Harry ,"I've been really trying to watch my ass, now that I'm living in your house.",
208,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,It's our house now.,
209,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,I want you to be yourself.,
210,6.0,9.0,Harry ,"Yeah, well, myself is pretty much a bull in a china shop.",
211,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,Then you're a bull in our china shop.,
212,6.0,9.0,Harry ,It's a bull.,
213,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- I get it.,
214,6.0,9.0,Harry ,- Just making sure.,
215,6.0,9.0,Robert,Hold it.,
216,6.0,9.0,Robert,"Hey, Yankee.",
217,6.0,9.0,Miranda,Welcome to the building.,
218,6.0,9.0,Robert,I have a feeling you had a little something to do with that.,
219,6.0,9.0,Miranda,Let's just say you owe me bigtime.,
220,6.0,9.0,Robert,You have a pock.,
221,6.0,9.0,Miranda,What? ,
222,6.0,9.0,Robert,"- On your face, right there.",
223,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"- Oh, my God! I must have gotten it from my kid.",
224,6.0,9.0,Robert,"- Oh, I thought you were single.",
225,6.0,9.0,Miranda,- I am.,
226,6.0,9.0,Carrie,It was the perfect first conversation.,
227,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Minus the pock.,
228,6.0,9.0,Robert,"All right, give me the lotion and cotton balls.",
229,6.0,9.0,Robert,Stat.,
230,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"- You don't really say ""stat""? ",
231,6.0,9.0,Robert,"- No, but it sounds good, doesn't it? ",
232,6.0,9.0,Robert,So this is the little germ-disseminator.,
233,6.0,9.0,Miranda,Also known as Brady.,
234,6.0,9.0,Miranda,Run while you're still breathing.,
235,6.0,9.0,Robert,"No, it's okay.",
236,6.0,9.0,Robert,I had the chicken pox when I was four.,
237,6.0,9.0,Robert,"Hey, where are you going? ",
238,6.0,9.0,Robert,He's a winner.,
239,6.0,9.0,Robert,I really want one of these some day.,
240,6.0,9.0,Robert,He looks just like you.,
241,6.0,9.0,Miranda,- You think? ,
242,6.0,9.0,Robert,"- Oh, yeah.",
243,6.0,9.0,Robert,"Okay, Mama.",
244,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"- You know, I could do this myself.",
245,6.0,9.0,Robert,"- Yeah, but I'm a professional.",
246,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"Magda, this is Robert.",
247,6.0,9.0,Miranda,He's moving in upstairs.,
248,6.0,9.0,Robert,- Hi.,
249,6.0,9.0,Magda,- Nice to meet you.,
250,6.0,9.0,Magda,- I'll take baby from there.,
251,6.0,9.0,Miranda,- Okay.,
252,6.0,9.0,Robert,You got another one.,
253,6.0,9.0,Robert,"Okay, Miss Hobbes, I think you'll live.",
254,6.0,9.0,Robert,But no scratching.,
255,6.0,9.0,Robert,Doctor's orders.,
256,6.0,9.0,Miranda,Okey-doke.,
257,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"For Miranda, Robert was just what the doctor ordered.",
258,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"Hey, Carrie, what a surprise.",
259,6.0,9.0,Carrie,I was in the neighborhood.,
260,6.0,9.0,Carrie,I thought you might want these back.,
261,6.0,9.0,Kyra,You didn't have to return these.,
262,6.0,9.0,Kyra,I had forgotten all about them.,
263,6.0,9.0,Carrie,- Any news on my shoes? ,
264,6.0,9.0,Kyra,- No.,
265,6.0,9.0,Kyra,It's weird.,
266,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"So, this Jennifer ",
267,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Did you ever find her sandals? ,
268,6.0,9.0,Kyra,What? ,
269,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Well, if she took my shoes, she would have left her sandals.",
270,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Just being a bit of a shoe detective here.,
271,6.0,9.0,Kyra,I haven't heard from her.,
272,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"Oh, my gosh, Carrie, I am such a shit! ",
273,6.0,9.0,Kyra,I should have offered to pay you for them.,
274,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"No, you don't have to do that.",
275,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"You know, you have kids and you lose all sense of social decency.",
276,6.0,9.0,Kyra,- Come in.,
277,6.0,9.0,Carrie,- Okay.,
278,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"Milo, honey, put your trucks back for Mommy.",
279,6.0,9.0,Kyra,So how much were they? ,
280,6.0,9.0,Carrie,485,
281,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"Come on, Carrie.",
282,6.0,9.0,Kyra,That's insane.,
283,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Well, that's what they cost.",
284,6.0,9.0,Kyra,I'll give you $200.,
285,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Okay, this is an awkward conversation.",
286,6.0,9.0,Kyra,I'm sorry.,
287,6.0,9.0,Kyra,I just think that's crazy to spend that much on shoes.,
288,6.0,9.0,Carrie,You know how much Manolos are.,
289,6.0,9.0,Carrie,You used to wear Manolos.,
290,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"Sure, before I had a real life.",
291,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"But Chuck and I have responsibilities now: Kids, houses $485, wow! ",
292,6.0,9.0,Carrie,I have a real life.,
293,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"No offense, but I don't think we should have to pay for your extravagant lifestyle.",
294,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"I mean, it was your choice to buy shoes that expensive.",
295,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Yes, but it wasn't my choice to take them off.",
296,6.0,9.0,Kyra,They're just shoes.,
297,6.0,9.0,Allegra ,Shoes.,
298,6.0,9.0,Carrie,She shoe-shamed me.,
299,6.0,9.0,Carrie,I left there covered in shame.,
300,6.0,9.0,Miranda,She's a fucking bitch! ,
301,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"But she isn't, that's the thing.",
302,6.0,9.0,Carrie,She's become this whole other person.,
303,6.0,9.0,Carrie,It's like she's had two caesarians and a lobotomy.,
304,6.0,9.0,Miranda,She owes you for those shoes.,
305,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"No, it's not about the money.",
306,6.0,9.0,Carrie,I don't care about that.,
307,6.0,9.0,Carrie,I'm talking about a woman's right to shoes.,
308,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Why did she have to shame me? ,
309,6.0,9.0,Miranda,Because she's trapped in a hell of her own making.,
310,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"No, wait, that's me.",
311,6.0,9.0,Miranda,I am dying to scratch these! ,
312,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"But if I do, it'll be worse.",
313,6.0,9.0,Carrie,How are they today? ,
314,6.0,9.0,Miranda,Biblical.,
315,6.0,9.0,Miranda,There's literally a pox on my house.,
316,6.0,9.0,Miranda,If there wasn't a Jules & Mimi marathon on BBC America this weekend I'd have jumped out the window.,
317,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Hey, speaking of handsome black men, have you spotted any more of Dr. Knicks? ",
318,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"Don't say ""spot.""",
319,6.0,9.0,Miranda,No.,
320,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"As a leper, I'm laying low.",
321,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"But according to my sources, he's officially in the building.",
322,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Is it bad that my life is filled with shoes and not children? ,
323,6.0,9.0,Miranda,Stop it! And she is a fucking bitch for making you feel this way.,
324,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"Oh, God! ",
325,6.0,9.0,Carrie,When we were young Marlo Thomas sang to us about accepting each other and our differences.,
326,6.0,9.0,Carrie,But then we got older and started singing a different tune.,
327,6.0,9.0,Carrie,We stopped celebrating each other's life choices and started qualifying them.,
328,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Is acceptance really such a childish concept? ,
329,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Or did we have it right all along? ,
330,6.0,9.0,Carrie,When did we stop being free to be you and me? ,
331,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"The next morning, Charlotte learned just how free the real Harry could be.",
332,6.0,9.0,Harry ,"Oh the shark has pretty teeth, dear ",
333,6.0,9.0,Harry ,And he shows them pearly white ,
334,6.0,9.0,Harry ,- Morning.,
335,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- Hi.,
336,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- Are you gonna take a shower? ,
337,6.0,9.0,Harry ,- In a little while.,
338,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Apparently, it took next to nothing to make Harry feel comfortable.",
339,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Charlotte felt completely trapped.,
340,6.0,9.0,Carrie,She wanted to see Harry be himself in her home.,
341,6.0,9.0,Carrie,She just didn't need to see that much of him.,
342,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, I decided to bare all to Kyra.",
343,6.0,9.0,Kyra,- Hello.,
344,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"- Hey, Kyra, it's Carrie.",
345,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Listen I feel weird about what happened the other day.,
346,6.0,9.0,Carrie,We've been friends a really long time and I just want to clear the air.,
347,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"Oh, my God, Carrie, I'd forgotten about that days ago.",
348,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Well, I didn't.",
349,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"I've been thinking a lot about it, and ",
350,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"Man, you must have a lot of time on your hands.",
351,6.0,9.0,Kyra,Milo! Pants stay on.,
352,6.0,9.0,Kyra,I'm serious! Penises stay in the bathroom.,
353,6.0,9.0,Kyra,"Carrie, can you hold on for one second? I'll be right back.",
354,6.0,9.0,Kyra,Thanks.,
355,6.0,9.0,Allegra ,Hello.,
356,6.0,9.0,Allegra ,"Hello, Santa.",
357,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"You know what, I am Santa.",
358,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"I did a little mental addition and over the years, I have bought Kyra an engagement gift, a wedding gift.",
359,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Then there was the trip to Maine for the wedding, three baby gifts.",
360,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"In toto, I have spent over $2,300 celebrating her choices.",
361,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"And she is shaming me for spending a lousy $485 on myself? Yes, I did the math.",
362,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,But those were gifts.,
363,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,"I mean, if you got married or had a child, she'd spend the same on you.",
364,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"And if I don't ever get married or have a baby, what? I get bupkis? Think about it.",
365,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"If you are single, after graduation there isn't one occasion where people celebrate you.",
366,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- We have birthdays.,
367,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"- No, we all have birthdays.",
368,6.0,9.0,Carrie,That's a wash.,
369,6.0,9.0,Carrie,I am talking about the single gal.,
370,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Hallmark doesn't make a congratulations-you-didn't-marry- the-wrong-guy card.,
371,6.0,9.0,Carrie,And where's the flatware for going on vacation alone? ,
372,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,You're right! Why should I get wedding gifts? ,
373,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,Finding Harry was gift enough.,
374,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"No, no.",
375,6.0,9.0,Carrie,I'm thrilled to give you gifts to celebrate your life.,
376,6.0,9.0,Carrie,I just think it stinks that single people are left out of it.,
377,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"So the moral of the story appears to be: Until I get married, I won't be seeing nothing from Kyra.",
378,6.0,9.0,Carrie,- How's the pistachio? ,
379,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- It's so good.,
380,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,You want some? ,
381,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, Samantha was trying to have a working lunch.",
382,6.0,9.0,Mother,Another bite? ,
383,6.0,9.0,Samantha,We got cut off.,
384,6.0,9.0,Samantha,"Look, I need to get him three VIP seats and ",
385,6.0,9.0,Mother,Look at you! Look at you eating your pesto.,
386,6.0,9.0,Samantha,"No, I don't want any shitty house seats.",
387,6.0,9.0,Samantha,Listen to me.,
388,6.0,9.0,Samantha,"- No, I can't have any ",
389,6.0,9.0,Waiter,- Excuse me.,
390,6.0,9.0,Waiter,We don't allow cell phones.,
391,6.0,9.0,Samantha,- Are you kidding me? ,
392,6.0,9.0,Waiter,- No.,
393,6.0,9.0,Samantha,I'll call you back.,
394,6.0,9.0,Samantha,I understand that my cell phone may be annoying to some but what are you doing about that noise? ,
395,6.0,9.0,Waiter,There's nothing we can do about that.,
396,6.0,9.0,Waiter,That's a child.,
397,6.0,9.0,Carrie,And that was all Samantha had to hear.,
398,6.0,9.0,Mother,You're a big boy.,
399,6.0,9.0,Samantha,Hello.,
400,6.0,9.0,Samantha,I understand that your child and I have to coexist in this city.,
401,6.0,9.0,Samantha,But perhaps you could take him somewhere more appropriate for a Happy Meal so I could have a happier one.,
402,6.0,9.0,Mother,"Seamus, that wasn't very nice.",
403,6.0,9.0,Samantha,I've made my point and he's made his.,
404,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,Honey! ,
405,6.0,9.0,Harry ,"- Hello, beautiful.",
406,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- Hi.,
407,6.0,9.0,Harry ,Do you know what we need to bring back in this house? ,
408,6.0,9.0,Harry ,Cocktail hour.,
409,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Charlotte realized there was something grosser than teabags all over her house.,
410,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Her husband's teabags all over her new white couch.,
411,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- Harry! ,
412,6.0,9.0,Harry ,- What? ,
413,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,"- No, I feel bad.",
414,6.0,9.0,Harry ,- About what? ,
415,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,"I'm trying to be less rigid, and I really do want you to be yourself in our house.",
416,6.0,9.0,Harry ,I know you do and I appreciate it.,
417,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,And I'm almost used to the whole naked thing.,
418,6.0,9.0,Harry ,I knew it was too much.,
419,6.0,9.0,Harry ,It's just me.,
420,6.0,9.0,Harry ,But I can put on clothes.,
421,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,No.,
422,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,I want you to be yourself.,
423,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,It's just ,
424,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,Maybe you could put something between yourself and the white couch.,
425,6.0,9.0,Harry ,I get it.,
426,6.0,9.0,Harry ,We've got kind of an ass-white couch situation here.,
427,6.0,9.0,Harry ,I will put on shorts.,
428,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,- Could you? ,
429,6.0,9.0,Harry ,- Of course.,
430,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,Now? ,
431,6.0,9.0,Charlotte,Love you.,
432,6.0,9.0,Robert,"Miranda, are you in there? I can see your feet under the door.",
433,6.0,9.0,Miranda,- Damn.,
434,6.0,9.0,Robert,- I just came by to check up on you.,
435,6.0,9.0,Miranda,- I'm fine.,
436,6.0,9.0,Robert,- I've seen it all.,
437,6.0,9.0,Robert,"I'm a doctor, remember? ",
438,6.0,9.0,Miranda,I'm fine.,
439,6.0,9.0,Miranda,Come on in.,
440,6.0,9.0,Robert,It's not that bad.,
441,6.0,9.0,Robert,"I've seen a 7' tall man's shinbone poking through his calf, so ",
442,6.0,9.0,Robert,- Where's Brady? ,
443,6.0,9.0,Miranda,- He's asleep.,
444,6.0,9.0,Robert,Too bad.,
445,6.0,9.0,Robert,I wanted to give him this.,
446,6.0,9.0,Miranda,I'm pretty sure his hand-eye coordination is still a little sub-par to make the team.,
447,6.0,9.0,Robert,"If he's gonna go pro, we gotta start him young.",
448,6.0,9.0,Robert,What are you watching? ,
449,6.0,9.0,Miranda,- It's just Jules & Mimi.,
450,6.0,9.0,Miranda,It's silly.,
451,6.0,9.0,Robert,- Yeah? What's it about? ,
452,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"Well, that's Mimi.",
453,6.0,9.0,Miranda,She's the landlord.,
454,6.0,9.0,Miranda,"Right next to her there is Jules, and they've slept together a couple of times but Jules may be involved with the girl who works in the sausage shop.",
455,6.0,9.0,Miranda,- In a nutshell.,
456,6.0,9.0,Robert,- He seems to be pretty into her now.,
457,6.0,9.0,Robert,I'm intrigued.,
458,6.0,9.0,Miranda,- Really? ,
459,6.0,9.0,Robert,- That and my cable's not hooked up yet.,
460,6.0,9.0,Mimi,"Jules, you know, you didn't have to bring the rent over in person.",
461,6.0,9.0,Jules,What's a few tube stops between friends? ,
462,6.0,9.0,Robert,I love a brother with an accent.,
463,6.0,9.0,Mimi,Do you think we'll stay friends after this? ,
464,6.0,9.0,Jules,I hope not.,
465,6.0,9.0,Jules,You're so soft! ,
466,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"That night, I decided I couldn't wait for a ring.",
467,6.0,9.0,Carrie,And so I gave someone else one.,
468,6.0,9.0,Answering Machine,- This is Milo.,
469,6.0,9.0,Answering Machine,- This is Allegra.,
470,6.0,9.0,Answering Machine,"Mommy, and Daddy, and baby Henry, and us aren't here.",
471,6.0,9.0,Answering Machine,Leave a message.,
472,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"Hi, it's Carrie Bradshaw.",
473,6.0,9.0,Carrie,I wanted to let you know that I'm getting married.,
474,6.0,9.0,Carrie,To myself.,
475,6.0,9.0,Carrie,And I'm registered at Manolo Blahnik.,
476,6.0,9.0,Carrie,So thanks.,
477,6.0,9.0,Carrie,Bye.,
478,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"One giant step for me, one small step for single womankind.",
479,6.0,9.0,Salesgirl,Here they are.,
480,6.0,9.0,Kyra,- That's all she registered for? ,
481,6.0,9.0,Salesgirl,- That'll be ,
482,,,Kyra,485,

484,6.0,9.0,Salesgirl,And could you please watch your children? ,
485,6.0,9.0,Salesgirl,We don't want them touching the shoes.,
486,6.0,9.0,Salesgirl,Thanks.,
487,6.0,9.0,Carrie,It was my very first wedding present.,
488,6.0,9.0,Carrie,"The fact is, sometimes it's hard to walk in a single woman's shoes.",
489,6.0,9.0,Carrie,That's why we need really special ones now and then.,
490,6.0,9.0,Carrie,To make the walk a little more fun.,
0,6.0,10.0,Carrie,I didn't go to my high school reunion.,
1,6.0,10.0,Carrie,So when my high-school sweetheart called me for a reunion I was curious to see if he looked like the boy I used to make out with in front of my locker.,
2,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Can you tell me how to get to Chemistry class? ,
3,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Actually, he looked better.",

6,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Don't wear it out.,
7,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Wow! You look great! ,
8,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I knew you looked great 'cause I saw you on the cover of your book.,
9,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"But I have to say, even better in person.",
10,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"God, I'm so glad you called.",
11,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"I'm going to be spending the month in Connecticut, so I had to look you up.",
12,6.0,10.0,Carrie,How are you? ,
13,6.0,10.0,Carrie,I heard you married somebody that you met in business school.,
14,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Yeah.,
15,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"I got divorced, like, two years ago.",
16,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Really miscalculated that one.,
17,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,So I'm on my own again.,
18,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,How about you? Are you seeing anybody or ,
19,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Nope.,
20,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Wide open.,
21,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- How is that possible? ,
22,6.0,10.0,Carrie,My high school boyfriend spoiled me for life.,
23,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Right.,
24,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Me and my AMC Pacer.,
25,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Oh, the Pacer! Oh, man! ",
26,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- I put our names down for a table.,
27,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Great.,
28,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"Look, earlier you said maybe you might have dinner plans.",
29,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Was that in case I turned out to be a ,
30,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Yeah, maybe.",
31,6.0,10.0,Carrie,But my fictional plans fell through so I'm available.,
32,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Miranda had no plans that night so she was thrilled when her cute, new neighbor stopped by.",
33,6.0,10.0,Robert,I didn't expect you home on a Saturday night.,
34,6.0,10.0,Miranda,Motherhood.,
35,6.0,10.0,Robert,So what's my excuse? ,
36,6.0,10.0,Miranda,I just got Brady to sleep.,
37,6.0,10.0,Robert,"- Now, do you sing to him? ",
38,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- Only if he's been bad.,
39,6.0,10.0,Robert,"Listen, I have these two courtside seats for the Knicks charity game at the Garden next Friday night.",
40,6.0,10.0,Robert,- Would you want to go? ,
41,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- I would love to.,
42,6.0,10.0,Robert,Great.,
43,6.0,10.0,Robert,- Great.,
44,6.0,10.0,Robert,I'll look for you there.,
45,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- Okay.,
46,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- Thanks so much.,
47,6.0,10.0,Robert,- Good night.,
48,6.0,10.0,Miranda,"You, too.",
49,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Miranda wasn't sure if it was a charity game or just charity.,
50,6.0,10.0,Carrie,I didn't even ask what you were doing in Connecticut.,
51,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"Nothing, for a change.",
52,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I spent the last decade working my ass off in Denver so I decided to take a month off.,
53,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Spend some time at sea level.,
54,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"So I've just been relaxing in the country, sorting through some things, you know.",
55,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Sometimes you need to get away.,
56,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Sometimes you wonder why you stayed away so long.,
57,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Well, this is my place.",
58,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- It's a nice place.,
59,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"- Yeah, I love it here.",

61,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- I know.,
62,6.0,10.0,Carrie,It's very unclear.,
63,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"I mean, this isn't a first date.",
64,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,We've already dated.,
65,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- And we've kissed.,
66,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- Many times.,
67,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Hours.,
68,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- We were in a lip-lock for most of 1982.,
69,6.0,10.0,Carrie,So what's one more kiss? ,
70,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,You mean business.,
71,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,That's a lot better without the gearshift sticking up my ass.,
72,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"It was a romantic, hot summer night followed by a miserable, hot summer day which was the fourteenth miserable, hot summer day in a row.",
73,6.0,10.0,Phoebe,- Samantha Jones.,
74,6.0,10.0,Phoebe,How are you? ,
75,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"- Great, Phoebe.",
76,6.0,10.0,Samantha,How are you? ,
77,6.0,10.0,Phoebe,Refreshed.,
78,6.0,10.0,Phoebe,We just dropped by the Soho House for a dip.,
79,6.0,10.0,Phoebe,"I mean, what else can you possibly do in this heat except sit by the pool and drink cocktails while they mist you with Evian.",
80,6.0,10.0,Phoebe,- Isn't it the best? ,
81,6.0,10.0,Samantha,- It's fabulous.,
82,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"I'm running to a lunch, otherwise I'd be up there myself.",
83,6.0,10.0,Samantha,Toodles.,
84,6.0,10.0,Samantha,There's a pool a block from my apartment and I can't get in.,
85,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- What pool? ,
86,6.0,10.0,Samantha,- At the Soho House.,
87,6.0,10.0,Samantha,You have to be a member and I'm on a bullshit wait list.,
88,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Don't they know who you are? ,
89,6.0,10.0,Miranda,"- And, more importantly, who we are who need to be at the pool with you.",
90,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"You know, in high school, all you had to do was jump a fence and you could be in somebody's pool.",
91,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Speaking of high school, I saw my high-school sweetheart and I think I might like him.",
92,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Again.,
93,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Is that crazy? ,
94,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,"- No, I love this.",
95,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,You could end up with your high-school boyfriend.,
96,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Okay, let's not jump the gun.",
97,6.0,10.0,Carrie,It was the best date I've had in a long time and I wasn't even thinking it was a date.,
98,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- When he kissed me good night ,
99,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- He kissed you good night? ,
100,6.0,10.0,Carrie,It was wild.,
101,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Because I actually remembered what it felt like to kiss him.,
102,6.0,10.0,Samantha,Imagine if you slept with him.,
103,6.0,10.0,Samantha,Talk about a homecoming.,
104,6.0,10.0,Carrie,No! ,
105,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- We never went all the way.,
106,6.0,10.0,Samantha,- Why not? ,
107,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Because we were kids.,
108,6.0,10.0,Carrie,We wanted to wait.,
109,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"And now, I think we've waited long enough.",
110,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,You're marrying him.,
111,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Will you stop? He doesn't even live in New York.,
112,6.0,10.0,Carrie,He lives in Denver.,
113,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- People move.,
114,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,It would be so romantic.,
115,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Or tragic.,
116,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Seriously.,
117,6.0,10.0,Carrie,If I had the guy in high school what have I been doing for the past 20 years? ,
118,6.0,10.0,Miranda,Why did you two break up? ,
119,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"I broke up because I thought, ""There must be better guys out there.",
120,6.0,10.0,Carrie,""" Turns out, there aren't.",
121,6.0,10.0,Carrie,That night I started thinking about my retro relationship.,
122,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Since high school, most women I know have acquired much better taste in clothes, hairstyles, and food.",
123,6.0,10.0,Carrie,But what about in men? Maybe we were better off when we thought less and kissed more.,
124,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Have we graduated past our ability to find true love? When it comes to matters of the heart, did we have it right in high school? ",
125,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Samantha was too cool to belong to any clubs in high school so she refused to believe that any club was too cool for her now.,
126,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Especially since New York in August is not cool at all.,
127,6.0,10.0,Soho House Manager,- May I help you? ,
128,6.0,10.0,Samantha,- I hope so.,
129,6.0,10.0,Samantha,I'd like to know what's holding up my membership.,
130,6.0,10.0,Samantha,I've been on the wait list since June.,
131,6.0,10.0,Soho House Manager,"Yes, I'm sorry, but we are not currently admitting any new members.",
132,6.0,10.0,Soho House Manager,"The pool is so fabulous, we're at capacity every day.",
133,6.0,10.0,Samantha,- Do you know who I am? ,
134,6.0,10.0,Soho House Manager,"- No, I don't.",
135,6.0,10.0,Soho House Manager,But we can't accommodate you right now.,
136,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"Can I at least use the restroom before I go, or is there a wait list for that as well? ",
137,6.0,10.0,Soho House Manager,"Down the corridor on your left, the door marked ""WC.""",
138,6.0,10.0,Cleaning Lady,"Miss, did you leave your card on the sink? ",
139,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"Oh, yes.",
140,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"Yes, I did.",
141,6.0,10.0,Samantha,Thank you so much.,
142,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Since they didn't seem to know who she was at the Soho House she figured she could be Annabelle Bronstein.,
143,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"The next day, Samantha tested the waters with her fake ID.",
144,6.0,10.0,Male Pool Attendant,"Excuse me, can I get you something to drink, Miss Bronstein? ",
145,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"Yes, but I'll just pay cash.",
146,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"And please, call me Annabelle.",
147,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Meanwhile, a fight was about to break out in the cafeteria.",
148,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"But this time, Cafeteria was a trendy restaurant in Chelsea.",
149,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- Thank you.,
150,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"- God, I hate him.",
151,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"Come on, we're going over there.",
152,6.0,10.0,Marcus,- Why? ,
153,6.0,10.0,Stanford,- Because you're in a tank top.,
154,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,Really.,
155,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- Hi.,
156,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"- Oh, hi.",
157,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,You're here.,
158,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,What a small world.,
159,6.0,10.0,Anthony,That's Chelsea for you.,
160,6.0,10.0,Anthony,Can't swing a dick without running into someone you know.,
161,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"We'd love to stay and chat, but we have to go get our tuxes for the prom.",
162,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,"Did you say ""the prom""? ",
163,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"Yes, it's a big fundraiser at the gay-lesbian-bi-transgender center.",
164,6.0,10.0,Stanford,- I'm on the decorations committee.,
165,6.0,10.0,Anthony,"- What's the theme, ""Queer and Queerer""? ",
166,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,I have the best memories of my prom.,
167,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,I was the prom queen.,
168,6.0,10.0,Anthony,"Of course you were, darling.",
169,6.0,10.0,Stanford,- I missed my prom in high school because ,
170,6.0,10.0,Anthony,- You were gay.,
171,6.0,10.0,Stanford,No.,
172,6.0,10.0,Stanford,My girlfriend and I broke up the night before because ,
173,6.0,10.0,Anthony,You were gay.,
174,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"- No, I wasn't gay until ",
175,6.0,10.0,Anthony,- You were born.,
176,6.0,10.0,Stanford,Never mind.,
177,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"Goodbye, Charlotte.",
178,6.0,10.0,Marcus,- Bye.,
179,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,"- Bye, Marcus.",
180,6.0,10.0,Anthony,Those two should be going to the gay-lesbian-and-prostitute prom.,
181,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- Be nice.,
182,6.0,10.0,Anthony,- What? I happen to know that Marcus used to be a gay escort.,
183,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- He was not.,
184,6.0,10.0,Anthony,"- Honey, wake up and smell the K-Y.",
185,6.0,10.0,Anthony,I was flipping through a vintage issue of Honcho.,
186,6.0,10.0,Anthony,I saw his ad in the Rauncho section.,
187,6.0,10.0,Anthony,He called himself Paul.,
188,6.0,10.0,Anthony,Worst hustler name I ever heard.,
189,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,He and Stanford are in love.,
190,6.0,10.0,Anthony,"Well, according to Honcho, he used to be in love all over town.",
191,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- You are mistaken.,
192,6.0,10.0,Anthony,- There's a picture.,
193,6.0,10.0,Anthony,I'll send you the ad.,
194,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- I don't want to see it.,
195,6.0,10.0,Anthony,"- I'm sending it, prom queen.",
196,6.0,10.0,Waiter,- What can I get you? ,
197,6.0,10.0,Anthony,- Cute waiter.,
198,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,I wish I didn't know this.,
199,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,Do you think Stanford knows? ,
200,6.0,10.0,Miranda,"Probably not, so maybe we shouldn't talk about it in Madison Square Garden.",
201,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,I don't think that these people know those people.,
202,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- Look at how cute he is.,

209,6.0,10.0,Miranda,You're right.,
210,6.0,10.0,Miranda,These seats are too good to be casual.,
211,6.0,10.0,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Knicks City Dancers.",
212,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,Did I ever tell you I was a cheerleader? ,

214,6.0,10.0,Miranda,Did you used to do that? ,
215,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,"No, we just did some kerkies and some kicks.",
216,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- What is she doing? ,
217,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- The blonde one in front? ,

247,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"Carrie, I need to be honest with you about something.",
248,6.0,10.0,Carrie,That's the worst thing you can hear from someone you really like.,
249,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I'm not really just taking time off.,
250,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I'm sort of in a mental institution.,
251,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"No, actually, that's the worst thing you can hear.",
252,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"I wanted a man who would commit, not a man who was committed.",
253,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Apparently, we have to be more specific.",
254,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- But how is he able to see you? ,
255,6.0,10.0,Anthony,- Did he escape? ,
256,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"No, he's voluntary.",
257,6.0,10.0,Carrie,He says it's not really a mental institution it's a therapeutic community.,

259,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Juno-Spears.,
260,6.0,10.0,Samantha,That's supposed to be a good one.,
261,6.0,10.0,Samantha,I've had clients go there.,
262,6.0,10.0,Stanford,Really? Why haven't we heard about that? ,
263,6.0,10.0,Samantha,Because I'm good at my job.,
264,6.0,10.0,Samantha,No one wants to admit they're in a loony bin.,
265,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- On a first date.,
266,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- It's all humiliating.,
267,6.0,10.0,Miranda,Think about what we have to go through to date.,
268,6.0,10.0,Miranda,"I am 38, and I am competing with a cheerleader.",
269,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"And even when you get the guy, you never know what fun surprise might be revealed.",

273,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,I don't think he knows everything.,
274,6.0,10.0,Carrie,What? What? ,
275,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Charlotte, like all girls, learned at an early age that the only way to get rid of information you don't want to have is to pass it on.",
276,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Oh, my God! Is this real? ",
277,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,Anthony found it in an old issue of Honcho magazine.,
278,6.0,10.0,Samantha,Let me see that.,
279,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"Oh, my! Is that Marcus? ",

283,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"Okay, hand it over.",
284,6.0,10.0,Stanford,Where did this come from? Someone better tell me where this came from right now.,
285,6.0,10.0,Stanford,I'm not kidding.,
286,6.0,10.0,Samantha,- I got it from Carrie.,
287,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- I got it from Miranda.,
288,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- I got it from Charlotte.,
289,6.0,10.0,Charlotte,- I got it from Anthony but I told him you and Marcus were very much in love.,
290,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Charlotte was still a cheerleader for love.,
291,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"But like the Knicks, her team was having a bad season.",
292,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"Well, you think you know somebody ",
293,6.0,10.0,Manager,"Excuse me, which one of you is Annabelle Bronstein?",
294,6.0,10.0,Samantha,- I am.,
295,6.0,10.0,Manager,"- Well, that's impossible.",
296,6.0,10.0,Manager,Miss Bronstein is in London for the week.,
297,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"No, I am Annabelle Bronstein.",
298,6.0,10.0,Manager,And she's British.,
299,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"As I was saying, dear sir I am Annabelle Bronstein.",
300,6.0,10.0,Manager,I'm fairly certain you're not Annabelle.,
301,6.0,10.0,Manager,I've spoken to her on the phone.,
302,6.0,10.0,Samantha,I am absolutely Annabelle Bronstein and I do not pay $900 annually to be treated like this.,
303,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"Now, ring round the waiter and have him tally up the drinks.",
304,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- What's with the accent? ,
305,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- She's got a case of the Madonnas.,
306,6.0,10.0,Manager,"I'm sorry, but I know for a fact that Annabelle lost her card.",
307,6.0,10.0,Samantha,"Yes, I thought I did but it was on top of the telly.",
308,6.0,10.0,Manager,"And Miss Bronstein is from Sussex, as am I and I'd venture to guess that you are not, in fact, from the UK.",
309,6.0,10.0,Samantha,That's true.,
310,6.0,10.0,Samantha,I was raised in Inja.,
311,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"On any given day, there are a lot of versions of ""crazy"" right here in New York.",
312,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Today, Annabelle Bronstein had multiple personalities and at least two accents.",
313,6.0,10.0,Robert,"Hey, Hobbes.",
314,6.0,10.0,Robert,Where did you disappear to after the game? ,
315,6.0,10.0,Miranda,"I was gonna thank you, but you were talking to that girl.",
316,6.0,10.0,Robert,- What girl? ,
317,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- Some cheerleader.,
318,6.0,10.0,Miranda,- Do you like her? ,
319,6.0,10.0,Robert,- No.,
320,6.0,10.0,Robert,I like someone else.,
321,6.0,10.0,Robert,You.,
322,6.0,10.0,Carrie,This cheered Miranda up immediately.,
323,6.0,10.0,Miranda,"Now, see, how would I know that? ",
324,6.0,10.0,Robert,Well ,
325,6.0,10.0,Robert,Would it be any clearer if I did this?,
326,6.0,10.0,Miranda,"- Hi, Mrs. McCaffrey.",
327,6.0,10.0,Robert,"- Hello, Mrs. McCaffrey.",
328,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I wanted you to have these.,
329,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Marbles.,
330,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"In case I lose any more of mine, I want to know where I can find a stash.",
331,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- How are you? Do you want to come in? ,
332,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- She asked with trepidation.,
333,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"No, I think it's great what you're doing ",
334,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"I know I probably threw you for a loop the other day, but ",
335,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"I should probably just come right out and say something about this, but I",
336,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"Truth is, I haven't worked out my rap on it yet.",
337,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"- Well, it's a tough thing to slip in.",
338,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"- Yeah, it is.",
339,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"""Hi, I might be crazy.",
340,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"Would you like to share an appetizer?"" The thing is, I think I made it sound worse than it is.",
341,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"If you saw Juno-Spears, you'd see it's not a cuckoo's nest.",
342,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,It's more like Canyon Ranch for the brain.,
343,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Do they have pilates? ,
344,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- They do have pilates.,
345,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I don't want to lie to you.,
346,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I am going through some pretty heavy stuff.,
347,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"I mean, soul-searching, really.",
348,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Trying to figure out why some things seem to be harder for me than they are for other people.,
349,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I think my family has something to do with it.,
350,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"- It's good to blame the parents, right? ",
351,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Right.,
352,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,So I figured I could spend the next five years in therapy or spend the next month and deal with it intensively right now.,
353,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,It's just more efficient.,
354,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- You make a very good case.,
355,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- That's what my doctors say.,
356,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"Well, that's it.",
357,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Ta-da! I just wanted to explain myself so that I didn't become known eternally as that nut case you dated back in high school.,
358,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"How about ""my high-school boyfriend who was the best kisser ever""? ",
359,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I could live with that.,
360,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"You're not bad yourself, either, you know.",
361,6.0,10.0,Carrie,That night we went all the way.,
362,6.0,10.0,Carrie,And we weren't the only ones.,
363,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"The next afternoon, my other crazy boyfriend stopped by.",
364,6.0,10.0,Stanford,It's true.,
365,6.0,10.0,Stanford,Marcus was a gay escort.,
366,6.0,10.0,Stanford,- But he's been off the market since 1992.,
367,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- So you talked about it? ,
368,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"Yes, and he says he did it just to put himself through dance classes.",
369,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"- But if that's true, then why keep it a secret? ",
370,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Maybe he was embarrassed.,
371,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"Yes, but it's not the escort thing but the secret thing that's bothering me.",
372,6.0,10.0,Stanford,I was the last to know.,
373,6.0,10.0,Stanford,I don't want to hear the truth from some bitchy queen with back issues of Honcho.,
374,6.0,10.0,Stanford,So we broke up.,
375,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"- Stanny, really? ",
376,6.0,10.0,Stanford,- Yes.,
377,6.0,10.0,Stanford,And right before the prom.,
378,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"And I still have to go, because I'm on the decorations committee.",
379,6.0,10.0,Stanford,And I have no date.,
380,6.0,10.0,Stanford,Again.,
381,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- When is it? ,
382,6.0,10.0,Stanford,- Tomorrow night.,
383,6.0,10.0,Stanford,Will you please go with me? ,
384,6.0,10.0,Carrie,I can't.,
385,6.0,10.0,Carrie,I have to visit my boyfriend at the asylum.,
386,6.0,10.0,Stanford,Of course you do.,
387,6.0,10.0,Carrie,He wants me to see the place for myself.,
388,6.0,10.0,Carrie,It's supposed to be like Canyon Ranch.,
389,6.0,10.0,Stanford,- Honey.,
390,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- I know.,
391,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- But I like him.,
392,6.0,10.0,Stanford,- You'd have to.,
393,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Who are we to say, he's got issues, he's getting help? Usually, that's considered a good thing.",
394,6.0,10.0,Carrie,It's New York.,
395,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Everybody's insane.,
396,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"- You slept with him, didn't you? ",
397,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Yes.,
398,6.0,10.0,Stanford,That's where the problems begin.,
399,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"You sleep with someone, you start rationalizing away all the red flags.",
400,6.0,10.0,Carrie,At least he was honest about it.,
401,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"Yes, unlike Paul.",
402,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Apparently, the Juno-Spears Center was harder than the Soho House to get into.",
403,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Or out of.,
404,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Even as a visitor, I could see how this was a very relaxing place to get away to.",
405,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"It's kind of nice, huh? There are great hiking trails all around here.",
406,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- Maybe later we can do a hike.,
407,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- I don't really hike.,
408,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Neither do I.,
409,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,But I will fill you in on something I discovered.,
410,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Hiking is walking.,
411,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- Really? ,
412,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"- Yes, hiking is walking.",
413,6.0,10.0,Carrie,I started to think maybe the Juno-Spears Center should be mandatory for New Yorkers.,
414,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Like the Hamptons or Fire Island.,
415,6.0,10.0,Patient,Feces! ,
416,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I guess that doesn't happen very often at Canyon Ranch.,
417,6.0,10.0,Carrie,I've never been.,
418,6.0,10.0,Carrie,It might.,
419,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Who am I kidding? This is a full-on psychiatric facility.,
420,6.0,10.0,Carrie,With pilates.,
421,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- You're definitely the sanest person here.,
422,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- Thank you.,
423,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,That's like being the best house on a bad block.,
424,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,People would advise you against buying it.,
425,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Maybe it wasn't the wisest thing to start something while I was still in here.,
426,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,Maybe when I get out in eight to ten months ,
427,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Eight to ten months? ,
428,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,My doctor still thinks I have a lot of work to do.,
429,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,"To be honest with you, I'm comfortable here.",
430,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I kind of like it.,
431,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,I like that everybody's craziness is out in the open.,
432,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- I loved seeing you.,
433,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,- I loved seeing you again.,
434,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,But I understand.,
435,6.0,10.0,Jeremy,We're just in very different places right now.,
436,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Ironically, it was the sanest breakup I ever had.",
437,6.0,10.0,Emcee,"And now, the Queen and Queen of our prom Carrie Bradshaw and Stanford Blatch.",
438,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"- Oh, my God! I love this song.",
439,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"- Me, too.",
440,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Thank you very much.,
441,6.0,10.0,Stanford,This is my best prom ever.,
442,6.0,10.0,Stanford,Thank you for coming.,
443,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Believe me, I'm glad to be back with the normal people.",
444,6.0,10.0,Carrie,You know the craziest thing of all? I somehow thought that after everything I've been through I might end up with my high-school boyfriend.,
445,6.0,10.0,Carrie,I don't think my story's going to get tied up like that.,
446,6.0,10.0,Stanford,- Your boyfriend might get tied up.,
447,6.0,10.0,Carrie,- And taken away.,
448,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"Okay, no more jokes.",
449,6.0,10.0,Carrie,I might be dating him in eight to ten months.,
450,6.0,10.0,Marcus,May I cut in? ,
451,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"No, thank you.",
452,6.0,10.0,Stanford,I already have an escort.,
453,6.0,10.0,Marcus,"Honey, I didn't tell you because it's part of my past.",
454,6.0,10.0,Marcus,It's not who I am anymore.,
455,6.0,10.0,Marcus,"I was really messed up back then, but I've got it together now.",
456,6.0,10.0,Marcus,And it's prom night.,
457,6.0,10.0,Marcus,We have to have a dance.,
458,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Why don't I get some punch? ,
459,6.0,10.0,Stanford,Just tell me one thing.,
460,6.0,10.0,Stanford,"Did you ever, ever sleep with that little bitchy pine nut, Anthony? ",
461,6.0,10.0,Marcus,No.,
462,6.0,10.0,Marcus,"God, no.",
463,6.0,10.0,Carrie,"So, maybe it won't look the way you thought it would look in high school.",
464,6.0,10.0,Carrie,But it's good to remember love is possible.,
465,6.0,10.0,Carrie,Anything is possible.,
466,6.0,10.0,Carrie,This is New York.,
0,6.0,11.0,Carrie,"There are some New York nights that are monumental, gigantic, historic.",
1,6.0,11.0,Carrie,"Others, are just big.",
2,6.0,11.0,Carrie,"Bet you can't get your steaks like this in your little Napa Village,",

10,6.0,11.0,Big,"Oh, let's. Let's fight, then we can make out.",
11,6.0,11.0,Carrie,"So, what's on your New York agenda?",
12,6.0,11.0,Carrie,"Making some deals, breaking some hearts?",
13,6.0,11.0,Big,Can I tell you a secret?,
14,6.0,11.0,Carrie,That's not your real hair?,
15,6.0,11.0,Big,I'm having a little heart thing done.,

33,6.0,11.0,Carrie,"Uptown, there was a different kind of dinner being prepared.",
34,6.0,11.0,Carrie,With less cholesterol and no tears.,
35,6.0,11.0,Miranda,Oh my god.,

42,6.0,11.0,Carrie,Doctor of all trades.,
43,6.0,11.0,Robert,Magda let me in. She was very excited at the idea of,
44,6.0,11.0,Robert,someone actually using your kitchen to prepare food.,
45,6.0,11.0,Miranda,"Well, it's a first.",
46,6.0,11.0,Miranda,I didn't know you could cook.,

58,6.0,11.0,Robert,Take tomorrow off.,
59,6.0,11.0,Miranda,From work?,
60,6.0,11.0,Miranda,I don't do that.,

66,6.0,11.0,Carrie,"Truth be told, Miranda had never taken a personal day in her entire career.",
67,6.0,11.0,Carrie,"But then again, no one had ever made her enchiladas before.",
68,6.0,11.0,Steve,"Whoa, geez, whoa.",

70,6.0,11.0,Robert,"- Oh, oh, hey.",

111,6.0,11.0,Robert,"Now, this should do it.",
112,6.0,11.0,Miranda,"So, that pretty much solves the problem",
113,6.0,11.0,Miranda,of how Robert and Steve are going to meet.,
114,6.0,11.0,Miranda,I guess I can check that off my list of things to do.,
115,6.0,11.0,Carrie,That's horrifying.,
116,6.0,11.0,Carrie,I will continue to be horrified by that story all day long.,
117,6.0,11.0,Miranda,"And poor Steve,",
118,6.0,11.0,Miranda,"he was in such a vulnerable position with the sex and the bloody nose,",
119,6.0,11.0,Miranda,and the doctor boyfriend.,
120,6.0,11.0,Samantha,"Well, you won.",
121,6.0,11.0,Charlotte,It's not a competition.,

124,6.0,11.0,Samantha,No contest.,
125,6.0,11.0,Miranda,"Ok, I hate to admit this,",
126,6.0,11.0,Miranda,but there is part of me that took some pleasure in the whole thing.,
127,6.0,11.0,Miranda,Is that terrible?,
128,6.0,11.0,Charlotte,"Well, no. It's not as like you planned it that way,",
129,6.0,11.0,Charlotte,did you?,
130,6.0,11.0,Miranda,No.,

81,6.0,14.0,Miranda,I don't even care about the wedding.,
82,6.0,14.0,Miranda,I just wanna be with Steve.,

87,6.0,14.0,Samantha,I can't believe it.,
88,6.0,14.0,Miranda,That's it. You're all freaking me out.,
89,6.0,14.0,Miranda,"Samantha, I expected more from you.",
90,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,He just felt inspired to write her a song and then he played it for her.,
91,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,Isn't that the most romantic thing you've ever heard?,
92,6.0,14.0,Harry,Yeah. Not bad.,
93,6.0,14.0,Harry,I used to play clarinet when I was little.,
94,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,This is so good. You have to have some.,
95,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,Doesn't that taste like real butter pecan?,
96,6.0,14.0,Harry,"Okay. If that's what we're playing, sure.",
97,6.0,14.0,Harry,I can pretend it's whipped flavored air's the real thing. Yum.,
98,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,I mean it's something out of the Victorian novel.,
99,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,People just don't do those things anymore.,
100,6.0,14.0,Harry,"Hey I can be romantic too, you know.",
101,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,Oh honey I know you can.,

104,6.0,14.0,Harry,I know how to do romance right. It's not just for foo foo foreigners.,

108,6.0,14.0,Harry,You bet. Let me get another lick of that.,
109,6.0,14.0,Miranda,I don't wanna make a big entrance. I don't want everyone staring at me.,
110,6.0,14.0,Carrie,And from looking to loving.,
111,6.0,14.0,Miranda,I just wanted to be like us. Like...,
112,6.0,14.0,Miranda,not like one of those millions cookie cutter weddings I had to suffer through.,
113,6.0,14.0,Miranda,How do we do that?,
114,6.0,14.0,Steve,What about one of those boat rides that goes all around the island? That's different.,
115,6.0,14.0,Miranda,"We're not boat people. When have we ever been on a boat together, ever?",
116,6.0,14.0,Steve,Okay. You got a better idea?,
117,6.0,14.0,Miranda,- Shit. ,

121,6.0,14.0,Miranda,"You see? We're bad people, not boat people.",
122,6.0,14.0,Miranda,We should get married right here in this mess.,
123,6.0,14.0,Steve,We're gonna have to if I can't get this gum off.,
124,6.0,14.0,Miranda,Hey.,
125,6.0,14.0,Miranda,That's a nice garden.,
126,6.0,14.0,Steve,Yeah. It's pretty.,
127,6.0,14.0,Miranda,But not corny.,
128,6.0,14.0,Steve,What do you think?,
129,6.0,14.0,Miranda,I don't hate it.,
130,6.0,14.0,Carrie,The only thing harder than choosing a spot for a wedding when you hate weddings,
131,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,What about a guestbook?,
132,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Is choosing a wedding gift for a friend who hates weddings.,
133,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,"Sweetie, there's gonna be like 8 of us there. There's no one to keep track of.",
134,6.0,14.0,Carrie,- Can't believe Miranda's getting married. ,
135,6.0,14.0,Samantha,- I know.,
136,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,- This is pretty.  ,
137,6.0,14.0,Samantha,- She'll hate that. Too domestic.,
138,6.0,14.0,Carrie,And too bridy.,
139,6.0,14.0,Samantha,Yeah. Let's try not to piss her off.,
140,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,Well maybe we should just buy her a stapler and wrap it in brown paper,
141,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,and just smear just dog poo on it.,
142,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,You think she'd be comfortable with that?,
143,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Fine. We'll get the dish.,
144,6.0,14.0,Samantha,Ladies. I have something to tell you.,
145,6.0,14.0,Samantha,And you're not going to like it.,
146,6.0,14.0,Carrie,"If you get married and leave me all alone, I will kill you.",
147,6.0,14.0,Samantha,As you know I have always loved my body just the way it is.,
148,6.0,14.0,Samantha,"My legs are fantastic, I have killer abs.",
149,6.0,14.0,Samantha,My ass is perfection.,
150,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Is this the part we're not gonna like?,
151,6.0,14.0,Samantha,But I have decided after careful consideration,
152,6.0,14.0,Samantha,that I might be ready for bigger boobs.,
153,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Since when?,
154,6.0,14.0,Samantha,Since I had a cold hard dose of reality.,
155,6.0,14.0,Samantha,From this. Look.,
156,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,You're in 'In Touch' magazine?,
157,6.0,14.0,Carrie,And that's your source of reality?,
158,6.0,14.0,Samantha,Yes. They named Smith Jarred the number one hot guy to watch.,
159,6.0,14.0,Samantha,They followed him all over town for a week.,
160,6.0,14.0,Samantha,I'm in half the pictures. See.,
161,6.0,14.0,Samantha,There are my boobs on Wednesday. See how small they are?,
162,6.0,14.0,Samantha,There they are again on Thursday. Teeny tiny.,
163,6.0,14.0,Samantha,And there they are having lunch. You can barely see them.,
164,6.0,14.0,Samantha,I should have bought my loop.,
165,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,I can't believe you would actually consider having a boob job.,
166,6.0,14.0,Carrie,I can't believe you went to Planet Hollywood.,
167,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,You are a confident intelligent woman.,
168,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,Why would you wanna look like a bimbo.,
169,6.0,14.0,Samantha,I wouldn't be getting the watermelon freak show kind.,
170,6.0,14.0,Samantha,I'd get something tasteful. Something like...,
171,6.0,14.0,Samantha,- yours. Yours are good.,
172,6.0,14.0,Carrie,- Mine?,
173,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,- What's wrong with mine? ,
174,6.0,14.0,Samantha,- They're not bad either. Let's see.,
175,6.0,14.0,Charlotte,Okay. All right. Get hers.,
176,6.0,14.0,Carrie,No.,
177,6.0,14.0,Carrie,A few days later the rain came.,
178,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,Listen if you like this poem.,
179,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Poem?,
180,6.0,14.0,Carrie,And so did the poetry.,
181,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,So long had life together been that once the snow began to fall,
182,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,it seemed an ending,
183,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,that leads to flakes should make her eye lids wince.,
184,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,I chilled them with my hand and,
185,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,they pretending not to believe that cherishing of eyes would beat,
186,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,against my palm like butterflies.,
187,6.0,14.0,Carrie,That is some serious stuff.,
188,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,"Had enough, huh?",
189,6.0,14.0,Carrie,No. It's beautiful.,
190,6.0,14.0,Carrie,How about I read you a little bit of my favorite poetry?,
191,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,Please.,
192,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Cocktails at Tiffany's calls for classic charm.,
193,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Oscar De la renta sleeveless silk five.,
194,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Full skirted dress with black-patented leather bow belt.,
195,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Now that is pure poetry.,
196,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,Oscar's a good friend of mine.,
197,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,I'll tell him you like the dress.,
198,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Oscar? You call him Oscar?,
199,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,"It's his name, isn't it?",
200,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,So you feel uncomfortable with the poetry.,
201,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,Why is that?,
202,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Look. I'm sorry. Perhaps we were not properly introduced.,
203,6.0,14.0,Carrie,I write a column based on the assumption that romance is either dead or just phony.,
204,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,You think I'm phony?,
205,6.0,14.0,Carrie,No. Not at all. I'm the one that feels like a phony.,
206,6.0,14.0,Carrie,"Frankly, I'm just not used to these grand gestures.",
207,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,"You mean no other man, no one write you a little poem",
208,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,or played a little music for you?,
209,6.0,14.0,Carrie,No. No they have not.,
210,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,Wow.,
211,6.0,14.0,Aleksandr,Okay.,
212,6.0,14.0,Carrie,I'm in over my head. Where are you?,
213,6.0,14.0,Miranda,Shopping for my wedding dress on my lunch hour.,
214,6.0,14.0,Miranda,"I said no white, no ivory.",
215,6.0,14.0,Miranda,No nothing that says virgin.,
216,6.0,14.0,Miranda,I have a child. The jig is up.,
217,6.0,14.0,Carrie,So. Yesterday the Russian read me a Russian poem.,
218,6.0,14.0,Carrie,"- But you know, in English. ",
219,6.0,14.0,Miranda,- Are you just making this stuff up now?,
220,6.0,14.0,Carrie,No. And this might sound crazy but I don't think it's an act.,
221,6.0,14.0,Carrie,I think he actually means it.,
222,6.0,14.0,Miranda,That doesn't make it okay.,
223,6.0,14.0,Miranda,Has he considered your feelings?,
224,6.0,14.0,Carrie,You're right. He's a selfish pig.,
225,6.0,14.0,Miranda,I'm serious. I think you should tell him this whole romance thing gives you the icks.,
226,6.0,14.0,Miranda,"Turns your stomach and that he's dating you, not Anna Karenina.",
227,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Okay I'll tell him that. I can't tell him that.,
228,6.0,14.0,Carrie,"And let me ask you something. If you're so anti-romance,",
229,6.0,14.0,Carrie,why are you having a wedding at all? Why not just go down to city hall,
230,6.0,14.0,Carrie,and get it over with?,
231,6.0,14.0,Miranda,"You know, I thought about that.",
232,6.0,14.0,Miranda,But then I realized I actually do wanna say those vows out loud to Steve,
233,6.0,14.0,Miranda,in front of the people I care about.,
234,6.0,14.0,Miranda,Are you gagging over there?,
235,6.0,14.0,Carrie,No. The opposite.,
236,6.0,14.0,Carrie,"My god Miranda, you're my cynical touchstone.",
237,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Do you promise to still be cynical even after you're married?,
238,6.0,14.0,Miranda,I do. I have got to go.,
239,6.0,14.0,Miranda,There's a big pile of tutus coming at me.,
240,6.0,14.0,Miranda,Okay. We need to have another talk.,
241,6.0,14.0,Carrie,One of the great things about living in New York City,
242,6.0,14.0,Carrie,is that you don't have to sugar coat your feelings.,
243,6.0,14.0,Carrie,But have New York women settled for a sugar free existence as well?,
244,6.0,14.0,Carrie,We accept Tasti-Delight instead of real ice cream.,
245,6.0,14.0,Carrie,E-mails instead of love songs.,
246,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Jokes instead of poetry.,
247,6.0,14.0,Carrie,"It's no wonder that faced with the real thing,",
248,6.0,14.0,Carrie,we can't stomach it.,
249,6.0,14.0,Carrie,Is it something we could learn to digest or,
250,6.0,14.0,Carrie,have we become romance intolerant?,
251,6.0,14.0,Harry,"Et puis pour la troisieme course, we would like the foie gras,",
252,6.0,14.0,Harry,"followed by the ""boeuf"" bourgignon avec la legume a la creme.",
253,6.0,14.0,Carrie,it was Harry's version of a serenade.,
254,6.0,14.0,Carrie,And Charlotte ate it right up.,
255,6.0,14.0,Harry,"Et en fin, le plat du fromage.",
256,6.0,14.0,Waiter,The plate or the cart? We have a lovely cheese cart.,

270,6.0,14.0,Carrie,And then there were the two biggest boobs of all. Right beside her.,
271,6.0,14.0,Waitress,Can I get you something?,
272,6.0,14.0,Samantha,You either have the most naturally beautiful breasts I've ever seen,
273,6.0,14.0,Samantha,or I need the name of your doctor.,
274,6.0,14.0,Waitress,You want doctor Bevel. He's the best.,

230,6.0,16.0,Samantha,I'm gonna take a bath.,
231,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"Apparently, Samantha wasn't the only one losing something that night.",
232,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"Samantha's not gonna die, right?",
233,6.0,16.0,Miranda,Of course not. She'll be fine.,
234,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Her hair started falling out at a really bad time.,
235,6.0,16.0,Miranda,Oh god. Was she at work?,
236,6.0,16.0,Carrie,No. But she was definitely doing a job.,
237,6.0,16.0,Miranda,No.,
238,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Oh yes. Ma'am.,
239,6.0,16.0,Miranda,She's a trooper. She'll be fine.,
240,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Yeah I know.,
241,6.0,16.0,Aleksandr,"But according to my Russian friend, we're all in denial.",
242,6.0,16.0,Miranda,What? What goes he say?,
243,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"Well, it went like this.",
244,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"Him: your friend might die, yes?",
245,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Me: No. You're all asshole.,
246,6.0,16.0,Carrie,We had our first fight.,
247,6.0,16.0,Miranda,I picked up on that.,
248,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"This is a man who is so sensitive about so much but then this death,",
249,6.0,16.0,Carrie,deal with it.,
250,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"I know he's Russian, but Jesus, come on.",
251,6.0,16.0,Miranda,Maybe it's the language barrier.,
252,6.0,16.0,Carrie,It's definitely a barrier for me.,
253,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Is this who I'm seeing? A man kills mice and optimism?,
254,6.0,16.0,Miranda,It's not denial. They got it early.,
255,6.0,16.0,Miranda,She's gonna be fine.,
256,6.0,16.0,Carrie,You are aware that you've said she'll be fine three times in half a block.,
257,6.0,16.0,Miranda,"Yeah. I just picked up on that, too.",
258,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"In any way, how's it helping her if we freak out about it?",
259,6.0,16.0,Carrie,It is our job to think positive.,
260,6.0,16.0,Miranda,Exactly.,
261,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Can you believe we're actually having this conversation?,
262,6.0,16.0,Miranda,No. And here's another thing I've never thought I'd be saying.,
263,6.0,16.0,Miranda,Steve wants us to move to Brooklyn.,
264,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"Okay. Stop. Now,",
265,6.0,16.0,Carrie,that is information I can't handle.,
266,6.0,16.0,Miranda,I know. I can't move to Brooklyn.,
267,6.0,16.0,Miranda,Even cabs won't go there.,
268,6.0,16.0,Carrie,My conversation with Miranda brought me back to reality.,
269,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"Or more specifically,",
270,6.0,16.0,Carrie,the people who want us to live in it.,
271,6.0,16.0,Carrie,The world tells us to get real.,
272,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"But what happens when living in reality means living in pain, fear, or Brooklyn.",
273,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"If the defense mechanism can get us through the difficult times,",
274,6.0,16.0,Carrie,how bad can it be?,
275,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Maybe the reality is we need denial.,
276,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Denial: friend or foe?,
277,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"Denial had become Charlotte's best friend,",
278,6.0,16.0,Carrie,next to Harry.,

282,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,- On what?  ,
283,6.0,16.0,Harry,- Adoption.,
284,6.0,16.0,Harry,It could be just a backup.,
285,6.0,16.0,Harry,You know? If we put ourselves on some lists.,
286,6.0,16.0,Harry,"By the time we know what's what,",
287,6.0,16.0,Harry,we'll have some choices.,
288,6.0,16.0,Harry,What do you think?,
289,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,That seems like the right thing to do.,
290,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,- Hi. Trudy. ,
291,6.0,16.0,Trudy Stork,- Hi.,
292,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,Hi Dandy Rich. Hi.,

295,6.0,16.0,Trudy Stork,Oh sure. She's not a show dog.,
296,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,Do you like that?,
297,6.0,16.0,Trudy Stork,Well she really loves you.,
298,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,Who wouldn't love her.,
299,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,Look at that face.,
300,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,"You know. Just because somebody doesn't perform the way that you want them to,",
301,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,doesn't mean you should just give up on them.,
302,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,Oh I'm sorry. I swore I wouldn't cry.,
303,6.0,16.0,Charlotte,I'm trying to have a baby and it's just not going very well.,
304,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"That day, thanks to a dog with one short leg,",
305,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Charlotte stopped denying her shortcomings.,
306,6.0,16.0,Trudy Stork,I don't care for babies. Or labs.,
307,6.0,16.0,Samantha,Thanks for coming.,
308,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Are you kidding me? This is gonna be fun.,
309,6.0,16.0,Samantha,I used to do this when I was 16 at the mall.,
310,6.0,16.0,Samantha,Without the cancer part.,
311,6.0,16.0,Samantha,I have a movie premiere and I need to look like myself at my most fabulous.,
312,6.0,16.0,Clerk,"What would you like, natural hair or acrylic?",
313,6.0,16.0,Samantha,"Sweetheart, does it look like I'd do acrylic?",
314,6.0,16.0,Clerk,These are our best natural hair.,
315,6.0,16.0,Clerk,Sassy and pretty-me.,
316,6.0,16.0,Samantha,No and no.,

319,6.0,16.0,Clerk,This looks like you?,
320,6.0,16.0,Samantha,"Carrie, how do I look?",
321,6.0,16.0,Carrie,You look like Florence Henderson.,
322,6.0,16.0,Samantha,Florence Henderson in a bad wig.,
323,6.0,16.0,Samantha,"Listen, I can't be on the red carpet in a bad rug.",
324,6.0,16.0,Samantha,Do you understand?,
325,6.0,16.0,Clerk,I know.,
326,6.0,16.0,Clerk,This is Candy. She's very popular.,
327,6.0,16.0,Samantha,I don't think you're listening.,
328,6.0,16.0,Samantha,I don't wanna look like Candy.,
329,6.0,16.0,Samantha,I just wanna look like myself.,
330,6.0,16.0,Clerk,Ma'am. These are wigs.,
331,6.0,16.0,Clerk,They're not ever gonna look exactly like you.,
332,6.0,16.0,Samantha,That is not acceptable.,
333,6.0,16.0,Clerk,We could style the bang.,
334,6.0,16.0,Samantha,Don't touch my head.,
335,6.0,16.0,Clerk,I've worked with many women with cancer.,
336,6.0,16.0,Samantha,I don't have cancer. I have a premiere.,
337,6.0,16.0,Samantha,And I don't want some second rate wig named after a hooker.,
338,6.0,16.0,Samantha,My hair is my thing.,
339,6.0,16.0,Samantha,This is bullshit.,
340,6.0,16.0,Samantha,Carrie?,
341,6.0,16.0,Samantha,We're going.,
342,6.0,16.0,Carrie,I'm sorry.,
343,6.0,16.0,Samantha,I'm just so angry.,
344,6.0,16.0,Samantha,The chemo I can handle. But this hair thing. It's too much.,
345,6.0,16.0,Carrie,"Sweetie, we'll find you a better wig. ",
346,6.0,16.0,Samantha,I have left hair all over Manhattan.,
347,6.0,16.0,Samantha,"Every time the wind blows, I have to check to make sure I'm not bald.",
348,6.0,16.0,Carrie,It's only temporary. It'll grow back.,
349,6.0,16.0,Samantha,"Until then, I have to look like a sick person and I don't do sick person.",
350,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Because you're not.,
351,6.0,16.0,Carrie,You're someone had a little blip of bad luck and now it's over.,
352,6.0,16.0,Samantha,What if it's not over?,
353,6.0,16.0,Carrie,It's over. So over.,

358,6.0,16.0,Samantha,"Carrie, please. Let me talk about what I'm afraid of. Please?",
359,6.0,16.0,Carrie,The denial part of me wanted to say you'll be fine.,
360,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Instead I said.,
361,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Okay. I'm here.,
362,6.0,16.0,Samantha,Maybe I should just shave it all off.,
363,6.0,16.0,Carrie,Yeah. You could be one of those fantastic bald women who's all about earrings.,
364,6.0,16.0,Samantha,I better not look like fucking Co-jack.,
365,6.0,16.0,Samantha,"Cancer. Turns out, not so hilarious.",

372,6.0,16.0,Samantha,"I'm shaving my head, all right?",
373,6.0,16.0,Samantha,And it's scary and awful and you can't handle it.,
374,6.0,16.0,Smith,Who says I can't handle it?,
375,6.0,16.0,Samantha,You freaked out after just a few little hairs.,
376,6.0,16.0,Smith,- You freaked out too. ,

378,6.0,16.0,Smith,Shit happens.,

380,6.0,16.0,Samantha,"Listen, this is very intense and you're being very sweet",
381,6.0,16.0,Samantha,but there is no way that you can relate to what I'm going through.,
382,6.0,16.0,Samantha,What are you doing?,
383,6.0,16.0,Samantha,No you can't. Your hair's your thing.,

474,6.0,16.0,Miranda,How long are you gonna play that cancer card?,
475,6.0,16.0,Samantha,As long as it takes for you to move back.,

50,6.0,18.0,Aleksandr,I'm going next week and I'm not sure when I'll come back.,
51,6.0,18.0,Carrie,"Unfortunately, having a man leave me for Paris was not foreign to me.",

108,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,- Where would you live?,
109,6.0,18.0,Samantha,- Is there a guest room? ,
110,6.0,18.0,Miranda,- Are you really thinking of going?,

113,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,- This is so exciting.,
114,6.0,18.0,Carrie,I know. My boyfriend has just asked me to go to Paris with him.,
115,6.0,18.0,Carrie,This is the most romantic thing that has ever happened to me.,
116,6.0,18.0,Samantha,What do you think they're doing down there?,
117,6.0,18.0,Miranda,"Not having a Billy Joel sing-a-long, that's for sure.",
118,6.0,18.0,Stanford,"Ladies, time's up.",
119,6.0,18.0,Stanford,I can't pretend to be one of the boys any longer.,
120,6.0,18.0,Carrie,So. I spoke to my girlfriends and they have a few questions about Paris.,
121,6.0,18.0,Aleksandr,But you are the one who's going.,
122,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Well we don't know about that yet.,
123,6.0,18.0,Carrie,I mean...,
124,6.0,18.0,Carrie,how could this work? Would I get my own place?,
125,6.0,18.0,Aleksandr,- Why do you get your own place? ,
126,6.0,18.0,Carrie,- I don't know.,
127,6.0,18.0,Carrie,I've never done this before.,
128,6.0,18.0,Aleksandr,You'll live with me. I have a beautiful apartment on the Left Bank.,
129,6.0,18.0,Aleksandr,But it's being remodeled.,
130,6.0,18.0,Aleksandr,So we would stay at the Plaza Athenee,
131,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Okay but are we talking a year? Indefinitely?,
132,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Don't I need to learn French? Would I be able to work there?,

134,6.0,18.0,Aleksandr,So many questions. Which is yours?,
135,6.0,18.0,Carrie,I can't remember. I think I drank too much Barolo at dinner.,
136,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Okay. Here's one of mine.,
137,6.0,18.0,Carrie,What about my apartment here? Would I sublet it?,
138,6.0,18.0,Aleksandr,- I would pay for your apartment. ,
139,6.0,18.0,Carrie,- That's crazy. I can't let you do that.,
140,6.0,18.0,Aleksandr,Why? I have plenty of money.,
141,6.0,18.0,Aleksandr,But I don't have plenty of Carrie Bradshaws.,
142,6.0,18.0,Carrie,And I've always wanted to learn French and drink wine before noon so basically,
143,6.0,18.0,Carrie,it's my fantasy complete with Parisian parties and museum openings.,
144,6.0,18.0,Miranda,But for how long?,
145,6.0,18.0,Carrie,As long as it's fun. ,
146,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Indefinitely.,
147,6.0,18.0,Miranda,So you'd be moving there?,
148,6.0,18.0,Carrie,No. Cause I'd still have my apartment here.,
149,6.0,18.0,Miranda,- Which he'd be paying for.  ,
150,6.0,18.0,Samantha,- He can certainly afford it.,
151,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,- Do you think you might get married? ,
152,6.0,18.0,Carrie,- No. That's..,
153,6.0,18.0,Carrie,I don't think that's the point.,
154,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,- Then what is he promising you? ,
155,6.0,18.0,Carrie,- The world.,
156,6.0,18.0,Miranda,But what about your job? Your column is all about New York.,
157,6.0,18.0,Miranda,You're all about New York. How would youˇ,
158,6.0,18.0,Carrie,I don't know.,
159,6.0,18.0,Carrie,How can you people still have questions? I got all of your questions answered.,
160,6.0,18.0,Carrie,And they were good answers by the way.,
161,6.0,18.0,Carrie,So this is the time when everybody should be really excited for me.,
162,6.0,18.0,Samantha,- We are excited. It's fabulous ,
163,6.0,18.0,Carrie,. - No. Forget it. Forget it.,
164,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,"- No, I think it's really romantic.  ",
165,6.0,18.0,Carrie,- Then stop killing it with questions.,
166,6.0,18.0,Miranda,We just wanna make sure you think this through.,
167,6.0,18.0,Carrie,I am thinking it through.,
168,6.0,18.0,Carrie,But it's a nice offer and it would be nice,
169,6.0,18.0,Carrie,if my friends could be happy for me.,
170,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Especially when I've always been happy for them.,
171,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,"Carrie, we are happy for you.",
172,6.0,18.0,Samantha,Anyone wanna talk about cancer?,
173,6.0,18.0,Samantha,Anybody?,
174,6.0,18.0,Carrie,They say the unexamined life it not worth living.,
175,6.0,18.0,Carrie,But what if the examining becomes your life?,
176,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Is that living or just procrastinating?,
177,6.0,18.0,Carrie,And what if all those helpful lunches and late night phone calls to friends,
178,6.0,18.0,Carrie,have made us all girl talk and no girl action?,
179,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Is it time to stop questioning?,
180,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Certain questions should never be asked by anyone.,
181,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Especially a husband.,
182,6.0,18.0,Harry,Think someone's getting a little chunky?,
183,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,Harry.,
184,6.0,18.0,Harry,I'm talking about the dog.,
185,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Elizabeth Taylor had gained 4 pounds,
186,6.0,18.0,Carrie,which for a dog who used to weigh 8 pounds seemed excessive.,
187,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,Hi. Can you tell me where the diet dog food is?,
188,6.0,18.0,Clerk,Oh I can't believe her. She's beautiful. May I?,
189,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,Yes she is beautiful. But she's getting a little fat.,
190,6.0,18.0,Clerk,Oh. She's not fat.,
191,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,You're right. That is an ugly word. She is full figured.,
192,6.0,18.0,Clerk,No. She's pregnant.,
193,6.0,18.0,Harry,Honey. I got your message. So the dog's knocked up?,
194,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,Yes. She's pregnant because everyone around me gets pregnant just not me.,
195,6.0,18.0,Harry,It's not like she planned it. She's a dog.,
196,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,Exactly. She's not even thinking about it and bam! On her first try.,
197,6.0,18.0,Harry,Well it might have been her first time but it was with at least 8 dogs.,
198,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,8 mutts. And we are gonna have to raise her whole trampy unpedigreed family.,
199,6.0,18.0,Charlotte,"Elizabeth, mommy can't look at you right now.",
200,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Miranda just doesn't like him.,
201,6.0,18.0,Carrie,- This is all about Billy Joel.  ,
202,6.0,18.0,Samantha,- It's not about Billy Joel.,
203,6.0,18.0,Samantha,It's about you.,
204,6.0,18.0,Samantha,We're not going to encourage you to cross an ocean.,
205,6.0,18.0,Samantha,We're selfish bitches. We like you in New York.,
206,6.0,18.0,Carrie,"Well I like me in New York, too. But I really like him.",
207,6.0,18.0,Carrie,"- He's great, isn't he? ",
208,6.0,18.0,Samantha,- Yes. A bit arrogant.,
209,6.0,18.0,Samantha,- But he's got the goods to back it up.  ,
210,6.0,18.0,Carrie,- And he can be really sweet.,
211,6.0,18.0,Samantha,- Then he's got it all.  ,
212,6.0,18.0,Carrie,- Then why does Miranda not like him?,
213,6.0,18.0,Samantha,She doesn't not like him. She doesn't know him.,
214,6.0,18.0,Carrie,She didn't try to get to know him. She didn't ask him one question all night,
215,6.0,18.0,Carrie,- and she is all about the questions. ,
216,6.0,18.0,Samantha,"- Well, here's a question.",
217,6.0,18.0,Samantha,Why do you care?,
218,6.0,18.0,Samantha,Have you ever heard me once ask what anybody thinks about my boyfriend?,
219,6.0,18.0,Carrie,I've never heard you use the term boyfriend.,
220,6.0,18.0,Samantha,My point is it doesn't matter.,
221,6.0,18.0,Samantha,Nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors.,
222,6.0,18.0,Carrie,- You know the most annoying thing?,
223,6.0,18.0,Samantha, - What's annoying?,
224,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Miranda has a point. What about work and everything.,
225,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Maybe I can't leave New York.,
226,6.0,18.0,Carrie,I don't know how I'd do some place else.,
227,6.0,18.0,Samantha,"Believe me, your fabulousness will translate.",
228,6.0,18.0,Samantha,And nobody says he gets to dictate the terms.,
229,6.0,18.0,Samantha,Figure out how to do it so you're comfortable.,
230,6.0,18.0,Samantha,"Maybe half the time you're there, half the time I'm there.",
231,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Well now you're being too supportive.,
232,6.0,18.0,Audiotape,Voulez vous a la discotheque?,

248,6.0,18.0,Carrie,just go to Paris for few months for your show?,
249,6.0,18.0,Carrie,Then it wouldn't feel like we're moving.,
