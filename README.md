## Exploratory Data Analyis <a class="anchor" id="eda"></a>

The present data set consists of 39208 lines of text with an average reating of 7.52 on IMDB. The poorest rating is 7.0, the highest rating is 8.8. The data set contains 94 unique episodes.

We first load the kaggle dataset ("satc_all_lines.csv"), which contains all lines of dialogue:


```python
satc_all_lines = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranilovi/SATC_rating_prediction/master/SATC_all_lines.csv").drop(["Unnamed: 0"],axis=1)
```

Then we need the IMDb ratings (and possibly other information) for the episodes. 
We used ParseHub to generate "imdb_eps.csv" in order to collect all episode IDs, which are the unique identifiers used by the IMBd API to run requests. 


```python
# get the imdb scraped information
eps = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranilovi/SATC_rating_prediction/master/imdb_eps.csv")
ep_ids = eps['ID']
# create an instance of the IMDb class
ia = IMDb()
# get the series
episodes =list(map(lambda x:ia.get_movie(x), ep_ids))
ratings = [x['rating'] for x in episodes]
eps['Rating'] = ratings
```


```python
# merge the two datasets to add targets:
satc_all_lines_w_rating = pd.merge(satc_all_lines, eps, how='left', 
                                   left_on=['Season', 'Episode'],right_on=['Season', 'Episode'])
satc_all_lines_w_rating['Episode'] = satc_all_lines_w_rating['Episode'].apply(lambda x: str(x).zfill(2))
```


```python
#satc_all_lines_w_rating = pd.read_csv("satc_all_lines_w_rating.csv").drop(["Unnamed: 0"],axis=1)
#create col with season and episode
satc_all_lines_w_rating['S_E'] = satc_all_lines_w_rating['Season'].astype(int).astype(str)+"_"+satc_all_lines_w_rating['Episode']
satc_all_lines_w_rating.head()
```

## Text Preprocessing <a class="anchor" id="#text-prepro"></a>

In order to perform an analysis of the present text, we pre-process the text (represented by seperate lines in our data set). We bring all words to lowercase to be able to compare words across their position in a sentence ("Hello" and "hello" should be the same word). We furthermore strip all text of special characters. 


```python
#text transformation
satc_all_lines_w_rating["cleaned"] = satc_all_lines_w_rating.Line.tolist()
#all to lowercase 
satc_all_lines_w_rating.cleaned = [str(line).lower() for line in satc_all_lines_w_rating.cleaned]

#remove special chars
chars_remove = ["@", "/", "#", ".", ",", "!", "?", "(", ")", "-", "_","â€™","'", "\"", ":"]
trans_dict = {initial:" " for initial in chars_remove}
satc_all_lines_w_rating.cleaned = [line.translate(str.maketrans(trans_dict)) for line in satc_all_lines_w_rating.cleaned]
satc_all_lines_w_rating.head()

print("Before transformation:",satc_all_lines_w_rating.Line[0],"\n After transformation:", satc_all_lines_w_rating.cleaned[0])
satc_all_lines_w_rating.head()

### Tokenization <a class="anchor" id="tokenization"></a>
We then tokenize the text, this means, we break up the text into invidiual tokens. We are using the NLTK tokenize package and are splitting sentences up into single tokens using word_tokenize. The method invoked by word_tokenize is using the "Treebank tokenizer", a tokenizer that uses regular expressions to tokenize text.

After tokenization, we remove stopwords from the text, using the english stopwords from NLTK. Stopwords are language specific word that carry no meaning for the purpose of a text analyis.


```python
print(str(len(stopwords.words("english")) ) +" stopwords are included in the stopwords corpus for the English language, containing words such as" + str(stopwords.words("english")[20:34]))
```

    179 stopwords are included in the stopwords corpus for the English language, containing words such as['himself', 'she', "she's", 'her', 'hers', 'herself', 'it', "it's", 'its', 'itself', 'they', 'them', 'their', 'theirs']



```python
#We are using NLKT tokenizer to split all text up into individual tokens
satc_all_lines_w_rating["tokenized"] = [word_tokenize(line) for line in satc_all_lines_w_rating.cleaned]

#Removing stopwords for topic extraction using nltk stopwords library
stopw = stopwords.words('english')
satc_all_lines_w_rating["w_o_stopwords"] = [[token for token in line if token not in stopw if len(token)>2] for line in satc_all_lines_w_rating.tokenized]
satc_all_lines_w_rating.head()

print("Before transformation:",satc_all_lines_w_rating.Line[0],"\n After transformation:", satc_all_lines_w_rating.w_o_stopwords[0])
```

    Before transformation: Once upon a time, an English journalist came to New York. 
     After transformation: ['upon', 'time', 'english', 'journalist', 'came', 'new', 'york']



```python
all_words = []
for line in satc_all_lines_w_rating["w_o_stopwords"]:
    for word in line:
        all_words.append(word)

dist = nltk.FreqDist(all_words)
X = [nb[1] for nb in dist.most_common(20)]
y = [nb[0] for nb in dist.most_common(20)]
x = sns.barplot(np.array(X),np.array(y))
x.set(xlabel='Word frequencies',ylabel='Words',title='Most common words in the Sex and The City Scripts')
plt.show()
```

```

## Natural Language Processing <a class="anchor" id="nlp"></a>
### Lemmatization <a class="anchor" id="lemmatization"></a>

In order to combine words that represent the same meaning, we are using the WordNetLemmatizer() to transform our corpus. "WordNetÂ® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations." [Source: https://wordnet.princeton.edu]


```python
# apply lemmatization from wordnet in order to merge words that come from the same meaning .- for example, "friend" and "friends" should be counted as the same word

def lemmatize(tokens):
    tokens = [WordNetLemmatizer().lemmatize(WordNetLemmatizer().lemmatize(WordNetLemmatizer().lemmatize(token,pos='a'),pos='v'),pos='n') for token in tokens]
    return tokens  

satc_all_lines_w_rating["lemmatized"] = [lemmatize(line) for line in satc_all_lines_w_rating.w_o_stopwords]
```


```python
#look at the difference in words 
print(satc_all_lines_w_rating.w_o_stopwords[0:5])
print(satc_all_lines_w_rating.lemmatized[0:5])

### TF-IDF <a class="anchor" id="tfidf"></a>


Tf-Idf is a widely used statistic in the field of information retreival, used to quantify the relevance of a query or key word to a document inside a corpus.  It is commonly used in search engine optimization and text mining. The statistic is designed to assigns higher relevance to a term if it occurs often in the document, but penalize it if it occus in many different documents, i.e. it is not unique or specific to one or few documents. The general formula to compute the Tf-Idf score for term _t_ and documet _d_ in corpus _D_ is:

<center> 
$tf.idf(t,d,D)=tf(t,d)*idf(t,D)$ <br><br>
$=\frac{n(t,d)}{N(d)}*log\frac{|D|}{d(t)}$<br><br>
</center>
where:<br><br>
$tf(t,d)$ is the term frequency function<br><br>
$idf(t,D)$ is the inverse document frequency function<br><br>
$n(t,d)$ is the number of times t occurs in d<br><br>
$N(d)$ is the number of unique terms in d<br><br>
$d(t)$ is the number of documents in D which contain t<br><br>

We are using a TFIDF statistic across our data set in order to understand, which words are significant in describing the content per episode. In our dataset, a document are all the lines of text spoken in one episode, and the corpus are all episodes together. 


```python
#group by episode to define one episode as one document for tf-idf

#initizalize new df
satc_text_per_episode = pd.DataFrame(
    columns=list(satc_all_lines_w_rating)[5:10])

#init
current_s_e = "1_01"
all_lines = []
#collect all speakers per episode 
all_speakers = []
carrie = 0
samantha = 0
miranda = 0
charlotte = 0
stanford = 0

for index, row in satc_all_lines_w_rating.iterrows():
        if(row.S_E == current_s_e):
            #we use the lemmatized version of the lines, change here for different choice of text preprocessing
            all_lines.append(row.lemmatized)
            all_speakers.append(row.Speaker)
            
        if row.S_E != current_s_e:
            #flatten all tokens for previous episode and add them to the dataframe

Exploring the tf-idf matrix by checking some of the highest and lowest scores:


```python
#some words with smallest and largest tfids
sorted_tfidf_index = vect_transformed.max(0).toarray()[0].argsort()
print('Smallest tfidf:\n{}\n'.format(feature_names[sorted_tfidf_index[:10]]))
print('Largest tfidf: \n{}'.format(feature_names[sorted_tfidf_index[:-11:-1]]))
```

    Smallest tfidf:
    ['tiny' 'whenever' 'track' 'round' 'perform' 'impossible' 'obvious'
     'exact' 'ahead' 'replace']
    
    Largest tfidf: 
    ['laney' 'threesome' 'pattern' 'phil' 'fake' 'model' 'yankee' 'zsa' 'soul'
     'javier']


We want to explore if there are any interesting correlations between the ratings and tf-idf scores of individual tokens (features). Since there are more than 9,000 features, we'll look at the correlation matrix of the 10 most correlated words:


```python
cols = satc_tfidf.ix[:,3:].corr().abs().sort_values('Rating', ascending = False).index[:11]

sns.heatmap(satc_tfidf[cols].corr(),cmap="YlGnBu", annot=True, fmt=".1g", linewidths = 0.5)
```

## Predictive Modeling <a class="anchor" id="prediction"></a>

### Model Comparison - Note

In order to compare the performance of different models, using different kinds of preprocessing and features, we designed the function evaluate_model in the process in comparing them. We will present different models and show their predictive capability by comparing error metrics, as well as looking at prediction precision with plots and other visual aids (such as a modeling of regression trees later on).

As the key metric to compare models with we are using the mean squared error regression loss. 


```python
# evaluate_model takes as argument
# modelname a string - to create an easy overview for final comparison 
# a model as provided by the sklearn library
# number of features: as selected with the function get_features based on their tfdif score 
# pca_dim: number of dimensions kept in pca, can be set to None if no PCA
# df: should be satc_tfidf or satc_tfidf_LPC
# LPC: boolean with default falue False, set to True if you want to include the lines per character as a feature 

# returns 
# results - dataframe containing results from 10 iterations
# model_details_and_averages - description of the input and average over ten iterations 
# target_test,target_pred_test - y* and y_pred for the test set

def evaluate_model(modelname,model,number_of_features,pca_dim,df,LPC=False):
    
    #get the words that we will look at in the analysis
    selected_words = get_features('tfidf',number_of_features)
    
    #define the features and targets 
    if LPC == False:
        features = df[df.columns[4:]].filter(selected_words,axis=1).values
        target= df['Rating'].values
    
    #if we also use lines per character, we need to select different cols
    if LPC == True:
        features = df[df.columns[8:]].filter(selected_words,axis=1).values
        target= df['Rating'].values
    

    #if pca_dim != None, create the pca model 
    if pca_dim: 
        pca = PCA(n_components=pca_dim)

    
    results={}
    #labels = satc_tfidf['Rating'].unique()
    num_run = 20

    #get ten results to account for randomness 
    for i in range (num_run):

        # separate datasets into training and test datasets once, no folding
        features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.3)
        
        #if pca, apply the dim reduction 
        if pca_dim: 
                features_train = pca.fit_transform(features_train)
                features_test = pca.transform(features_test)

        # train the features and target datasets and fit to a model
        trained_model = model.fit(features_train, target_train)


        # predict target with feature test set using trained model
        target_pred_train = list(trained_model.predict(features_train))
        target_pred_test = list(trained_model.predict(features_test))

        results[i]=[metrics.mean_squared_error(target_test, target_pred_test),
                metrics.mean_absolute_error (target_test, target_pred_test),
                metrics.explained_variance_score(target_test, target_pred_test),
                metrics.r2_score(target_test, target_pred_test),
                   ]

    results = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data=results,orient='index',columns=['MSE','MAbsE', 'Explained_variance_score','R_squared']) 
    model_details_and_averages = [
    str(modelname),
    number_of_features,pca_dim,
    results.MSE.mean(),
    results.MAbsE.mean(),
    results.Explained_variance_score.mean(),
    results.R_squared.mean(),

#evaluate model without lines per char

### Dimensionality Reduction  <a class="anchor" id="dimensionality"></a> 

Calculating the TF-IDF scores for each word that occurs in the data set, we end up with a matrix of the shape 93x8926, 93x8930 if we want to includge the lines spoken per character per episode in our data set. We are dealing with p>>n, a data set where the number of then the number of variables is much higher then the number of observations. We furthermore have an extremely sparse matrix because of the nature of the TF-IDF matrix. 

We are going to look at different ways to reduce the dimensionality: 
 + Preselection of features based on their TF-IDF scores
 + Dimensionality Reduction based on Principal Component Analysis



```python
satc_tfidf.shape
```




    (92, 9692)




```python
satc_tfidf_LPC.shape
```




    (92, 9696)



#### Preselection of Features  <a class="anchor" id="pre-feat"></a> 


```python
def get_features(method ='tf', k=100):
    k=k
    if (method == 'tfidf'):
        #getting topK highest tfidf words
        top_k = feature_names[sorted_tfidf_index[:-(k+1):-1]]
    elif (method == 'tf'):
        #topK most common words
        counter = Counter([item for sublist in satc_text_per_episode['all_text'] for item in sublist])
        top_k = counter.most_common(k)
    else:
        top_k = None
        print("Bad input!! Choose tf or tfidf as first arg")
    
    return list(top_k)
```


```python
features_words = get_features('tfidf',50)
print(features_words)
```

    ['laney', 'threesome', 'pattern', 'phil', 'fake', 'model', 'yankee', 'zsa', 'soul', 'javier', 'church', 'ghost', 'sam', 'shrink', 'honeymoon', 'jim', 'postit', 'sandwich', 'cheat', 'rabbit', 'jeremy', 'whore', 'fetish', 'karma', 'weight', 'gay', 'raw', 'myth', 'bitsy', 'paris', 'atlantic', 'madeline', 'stewardess', 'shoe', 'dildo', 'berger', 'mao', 'sailor', 'change', 'ray', 'lsland', 'vogue', 'game', 'ball', 'money', 'email', 'freak', 'nina', 'marry', 'ovary']


 #### Principal Component Analysis  <a class="anchor" id="pca"></a> 
 
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The resulting vectors (each being a linear combination of the variables and containing n observations) are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set.

We are dealing with 9000 different dimensions on the variable side, of which we can probably disregard most: most tf-idf entries in the matrix carry little information. We are therefore interested in reducing the dimensionality of our predictor variables. 

### Linear Regression <a class="anchor" id="linreg"></a>

To get an idea of a base MSE that we can achieve with our data set, we perform a linear regression that uses the least squares metric. We use this model to perform a grid search: We look at the MSE that we achieve with our data set taking in to account different number of features (from 100 - 9000) and different number of PCA dimensions. By doing so, we can better understand which method of dimensionality reduction serves our objective of creating a predictive model for the given data set best.

#### Linear Regression, no Regularization


```python
linear_regression = LinearRegression() 

#Linear Regression with all features and 50 PCA Dimensions
eval_linreg = evaluate_model("linreg",linear_regression,900,10,satc_tfidf)
y_star,y_pred = eval_linreg[2:4]

# Plot the predicted vs the actual medv response
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(8,6))
ax.scatter(y_pred,y_star , facecolor='None', edgecolor='b')
# add a reference unity line
ax.plot([min(y_pred), max(y_pred)], [min(y_star), max(y_star)], linestyle='--', color='k');
ax.set_xlabel('y_predicted')
ax.set_ylabel('y_star')
```

By doing a grid search for all possible combinations of dimension and PCA and ploting them against the MSE, we cannot identify a pattern. Since we prefer a less complex model to a more complex one, if they both possess the same explanatory power, we do another grid search looking at a small number of features and all PCA dimensions.  We get the best results for PCA dimensions <20, regardless of the number of features taken into account. This makes sense, since applying a PCA will modify the variables in a way that we expect to be ignoring most features anyway.

We get an MSE of 0.053225, with an absolute Explained Erorr of around 0.186675 is our baseline score to judge further models.

gridsearch_linreg_small = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Name","features","pca_dim",'MSE','MAbsE', 'Explained_variance_score','R_squared'])

#### Penalized Regression using Lasso

As we are using sparse data, it makes sense to use regularization methods such a Lasso or Ridge regression. We are using the sklearn Lasso linear model with iterative fitting along a regularization path. The best model (with the best regularization parameter) is selected by cross-validation.

The optimization objective for Lasso is:

(1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||y - Xw||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||_1

We get a similar MSE (0.053387) as before for 500 features. 


```python
#lasso_model = LassoCV(n_alphas=100, alphas=[.01,.1,1,10,100]) 
lasso_model = LassoCV() 

gridsearch_lasso = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Name","features","pca_dim",'MSE','MAbsE', 'Explained_variance_score','R_squared'])

#pca dim should be in between 20 and 30 
featuredim = 500 

for pcadim in range(0,30):
    if pcadim == 0:
            pcadim = None 
    gridsearch_lasso.loc[len(gridsearch_lasso)] = evaluate_model("lasso_model",lasso_model,featuredim,pcadim,satc_tfidf)[1]

```

### Decision Tree Regressor <a class="anchor" id="regtrees"></a>

Decision tree learning uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). We can use this method to get an idea of the different feature importances and maybe get to a better result. 

We are comparing two different models and get better results for a tree with reduced depth: If set the minimum samples split size to 10, we get a better MSE then e.g. for split size 2. We will compare different options in the final evaluation. 


```python
# Get the predictors and the response values
X = satc_tfidf[satc_tfidf.columns[4:]].filter(features_words,axis=1).values
y = satc_tfidf['Rating'].values
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.3, random_state=0)
```


```python
# Create an sklearn decision tree object using the mse metric for splitting, considering all the features and 
# splitting if there are more than 10 samples at a node.
tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_features=None, min_samples_split=10)
tree_est = tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### All Features, Low Depth
Decision Tree taking into account all features at every splitting step, minimum sample split = 10: 


```python
# use sklearn's export to generate the dot-data string file with all the nodes and their props.
dot_data = export_graphviz(tree_est, out_file='boston_tree.dot',feature_names=satc_tfidf[satc_tfidf.columns[4:]].filter(features_words,axis=1).columns[0:],filled=True, 
                           rounded=True, special_characters=True)

with open('boston_tree.dot') as f:
    dot_graph = f.read()  
# create the source object
I = graphviz.Source(dot_graph, format='png', engine='dot')
# Use ipython Image to shrink the rendered image of the source obj to fit into jupyter nb.
Image(I.render())
```

```python
feature_importances = pd.Series(data=tree.feature_importances_, index=list(satc_tfidf[satc_tfidf.columns[4:]].filter(features_words,axis=1)))
feature_importances.sort_values(axis=0, ascending=False)[0:15]

#### 50 Features, High Depth
We create a second model that splits up until "the end": We split as long as there are more then two samples at a node of the tree. We get a much more comprehensive image of the tree. 


```python
tree2 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_features=20, min_samples_split=2)
tree_est2 = tree2.fit(X_train, y_train)
```


```python
dot_data = export_graphviz(tree_est2, out_file='boston_tree.dot',feature_names=satc_tfidf[satc_tfidf.columns[4:]].filter(features_words,axis=1).columns[0:],filled=True,

### Random Forest Regressor <a class="anchor" id="randomforest"></a>

A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. 
Depending on the number of estimators (the number of trees that are averaged out) we get different results for the model. However, we don't get any results better then the MSE of around 0,05 that we have seen before. Plotting the predicted y shows that we still get a fairly bad prediction. 

Doing a grid search shows that don't see different MSE scores for chaning the number of estimators between 20 and 100. 


```python
randomforest = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=500)
randomforest_est =  randomforest.fit(X_train, y_train)
```


```python
# Get the predictors and the response values
X = satc_tfidf[satc_tfidf.columns[4:]].filter(features_words,axis=1).values
y = satc_tfidf['Rating'].values
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.3, random_state=0)

y_pred = randomforest.predict(X_test)

# Plot the predicted vs the actual medv response
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(8,6))
ax.scatter(y_pred, y_test, facecolor='None', edgecolor='b')
# add a reference unity line
ax.plot([min(y_pred), max(y_pred)], [min(y_test), max(y_test)], linestyle='--', color='k');
ax.set_xlabel('y_predicted')
ax.set_ylabel('y_actual')

mse = np.mean((y_pred-y_test)**2)
print("MSE random forest, 200 esitmators = ", mse)
```

    MSE random forest, 200 esitmators =  0.05687050399999854

### XG Boost <a class="anchor" id="xgb"></a>

As we are dealing with a weak regressor, we can use gradient boosting to create an ensemble of weak regression trees. 
XGBoost is a library that uses gradient boosting to achieve this. 

We are using XGBoost for this: XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. 

We get the best results for a tree with depth = 1, this corresponds to a simple linear regression. 


```python
features_df = satc_tfidf[satc_tfidf.columns[4:]].filter(features_words,axis=1)
features = features_df.values

### Prediction Including the Lines per Character <a class="anchor" id="lpc"></a>

We added four additional columns to the dataframe in order to take into account the lines spoken per character per episode. Plotting the lines spoken per person against their Ratings 


```python
satc_tfidf_LPC.head()
corr_carrie = satc_tfidf_LPC['Rating'].corr(satc_tfidf_LPC['lines_carrie'])
corr_miranda = satc_tfidf_LPC['Rating'].corr(satc_tfidf_LPC['lines_miranda'])
corr_charlotte = satc_tfidf_LPC['Rating'].corr(satc_tfidf_LPC['lines_charlotte'])
corr_samantha = satc_tfidf_LPC['Rating'].corr(satc_tfidf_LPC['lines_samantha'])

print("Correlation between the ratings and lines spoken by Samantha {corr_samantha}\n".format(corr_samantha=corr_samantha))
print("Correlation between the ratings and lines spoken by Miranda {corr_miranda}\n".format(corr_miranda=corr_miranda))
print("Correlation between the ratings and lines spoken by Charlotte {corr_charlotte}\n".format(corr_charlotte=corr_charlotte))
print("Correlation between the ratings and lines spoken by Carrie {corr_carrie}\n".format(corr_carrie=corr_carrie))

```

    Correlation between the ratings and lines spoken by Samantha -0.011113981965701352

### Model Comparison <a class="anchor" id="modelcomp"></a>

To conclude, we can say that it is not possible to predict the rating on IMDB based on the sripts. 95% of the ratings fall into a std of 0.28 +/- the mean of all ratings. We are not able to get a Mean Absolute Error of below ~0.19 - all of our prediction models are still predicting pretty much random outcomes. 

One of the reasons for this might be the narrow range in which we find the ratings of all episodes (all ratings lie between 7-8.8). It is also possible, that even though viewers liked episodes differently based on their content, they did not know how to express these differences in the rating. 


```python
model_comparison_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Name","features","pca_dim",'MSE','MAbsE', 'Explained_variance_score','R_squared'])
#evaluate_model(model, number_of_features,pca_dim,df):

#get model scores, average of ten iterations

## Episode Lookup <a class="anchor" id="keyword"></a>

Since we aren't very successful at predicting episode ratings, let's just watch some SATC! But which episode to watch?

This simple application recommends episodes based on a keyword query. Using a robust word vectorizer trained on the Google News dataset, it uses a heuristic approach to generate words similar to the lookup term, and rank the most relevant episodes based on the tf-idf score. 

Happy binging!


```python
my_q = 300 # to match dim of GNews word vectors
mcount = 1 # minimal word frequency  

w2v = Word2Vec(size = my_q, min_count = mcount)
w2v.build_vocab(list(satc_text_per_episode["all_text"]))
```


```python
w2v.intersect_word2vec_format("C:\\Users\\dorar_000\\Documents\\GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz", binary = True)
#w2v.intersect_word2vec_format("/Users/robertaconrad/documents/07_Ecole_Polytechnique_Studienunterlagen/DataCampCapgemini/session7/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz", binary = True)
```


```python
def recommender(word):
    ## generating similar words and their weights
    words = [word] +list(map(lambda x: x[0], w2v.similar_by_word(word)))
    weights = [1] + list( map(lambda x: x[1], w2v.similar_by_word(word)))
    
    ## raniking the episodes on the weighed average tf-idf
    reco = satc_tfidf.filter(words, axis=1).dot(weights).sort_values(ascending = False)[:10]
    
    ##getting the correct ep indices
    ep_ids = eps.iloc[reco.index]['ID']
    
    for (i, index) in enumerate(list(reco.index)): ##printing episode informtion
        
        print ("Recommendation {:.0f}: Season {:.0f}, Episode {:.0f}".format(i+1,eps.iloc[index]['Season'],eps.iloc[index]['Episode']))
        print (episodes[index].summary())
        print ()
        print ()
    
```


```python
## safe input handling KeyError Exception, and checking input is inside the vocab.
while True:
    try:
        word = input("Enter keyword: ")
        recommender(word)

Carrie believes her rekindled relationship with Mr. Big is good enough to get him to know her friends a little better. Samantha has an atypical lover, even for a man-eater like her: Donald Trump's single friend Ed is past 70, so will his old-fashioned wooing and lavish gifts outweigh his physical decay?

    Plot: The quartet's morning meeting hears counterbalancing news: Charlotte is elated to show her engagement ring from Harry while Carrie, infuriatingly pissed off, is determined not to make the day 'the day she got broke up with a post-it', as Berger chose this excessively succinct medium to beat her to the dumping line. Samantha takes the girls to a new club called 'Bed' where Miranda, who just discovered because of being too busy to eat she can fit into her skinny jeans once again, meets a nice man, Peter. Carrie drags everyone out after having lectured Berger's friends about imaginary break-up etiquette and manages to get street kids to sell them pot. Samantha hears Smith on TV putting on the 'I'm still single' act she advised him and finds she doesn't like how it sounds.

When Carrie can't help herself and criticizes a futile detail in Berger's book, even though she loves it, he shuts down; Samantha cuts of Jerry when he confesses being in AA; both couples soon make up. Charlotte makes her first sabbath a grand production- her pride and nitpicking don't make Harry set a wedding date as she desperately wanted but even walk out altogether.

    Plot: Samantha's announcement she's giving Richard another chance after his unfaithfulness, as nobody's perfect and it was 'only sex', is such a bomb-shell that even Charlotte makes an obscene gesture. Although Miranda is atheist, she can't deny Steve's entire Catholic family having the baby baptized. Just when Carrie felt down having to write about relationships without having one herself, she gets invited by a publisher to select some of her columns as a book. Eternally positive Charlotte drags Carrie along to the Fountain of Faith, but stands up to say faith didn't suffice for her.
